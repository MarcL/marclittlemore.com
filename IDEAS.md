## Testing

- how to mock/stub properly? what's the limit/what I shouldn't mock? How to write reliable and relevant tests (i see too often basic snapshots that gives no confidence in the sourcecode)?
- I’d say my biggest struggle now is getting buy-in from the other members on my front-end team that testing is worthwhile. I’m hoping concepts I learn in this course can help me to convince them.
- I think the most difficult part in writing test cases is to figure out which function/code I want to cover under test cases. I am currently working as a developer in a startup and we do not want to invest a large portion of our time in writing test cases and so we want to write test cases for most important APIs/features only. Now the question is should i write test case for each and every helper function for that API, or should I write test case for a complete end to end API. I think the second option would involve too much mocking as code is in backend service and it is interacting with databases, s3, and with other microservices etc. So it would be great if you can suggest this.
