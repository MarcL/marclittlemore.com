On the 11th and 12th June 2019, I was lucky enough to attend the Lead Developer conference in London’s iconic Barbican Centre. It was a two day event with a unique focus around the trials and tribulations of technical leadership. I'd heard great things about the conference and it was my first time attending. As my team at the BBC will attest, I found it extrememly valuable and haven't stopped talking about it!

Since moving to an engineering team lead role a few years ago, it’s been an interesting challenge to understand how to lead and grow a team of software engineers, so it was great to meet like-minded technical managers from other companies. It featured fascinating talks from CTOs, engineering managers and also junior engineers on the issues we face when building software and managing the teams that develop it. Some highlights included the power of positive transformation via the medium of dog training, different flavours of technical leadership, and levelling up your development team using analogies to video games. It concluded with a time travelling duo discussing flexible working through some on-brand Doctor Who time travelling!
