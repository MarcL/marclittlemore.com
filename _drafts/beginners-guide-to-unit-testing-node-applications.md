### From Reddit

[Reddit Node Testing](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/55knql/nodejs_testing_tutorials/)

> Make it more comprehensive (i.e. more suites jasmine, nemo, etc), throw in some comparisons (biased or not) and i'd totally read it.

> +1 I'll read anything you publish on the matter. I don't have much experience at all with testing in general, but will be starting to learn TDD next week so I've been compiling a list of resources to learn from. I'd be happy to add yours to the list and provide feedback, but like I said I'm a complete noob when it comes to testing so that's the type of feedback you'd be getting :)

> I'd like to read some good explanations on tips for creating a beneficial series of unit tests. I realize that a unit test may be a simple function input output test, but what about complex systems with multiple functions/ outputs and even multiple desired outcomes?
I have been using chai, mocha and superagent. Are there ways to test oauth2 authentications (like Facebook)?
What about DB testing? Or load testing? What are some setup recommendations?
I think any of this would be very useful, as there doesn't seem to be much out there for examples. Or if there was - they are too simple of examples...

> I have been muddling around through nodejs in my spare time for almost 3 years. I've been trying to wrap my head around unit testing; I find a lot of the articles really add to the noise.
I branched off and figured out how to do a simple series of unit tests... i suggest just focusing on the theory of unit testing vs the frameworks.


### Setup

* Explain unit testing
* Basic project - Node + Express middleware
* Test runner - Mocha
* Assertion library - Chai
* Stub library - Sinon
