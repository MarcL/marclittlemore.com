## Don't Let It Define You
This is probably the hardest thing for me to deal with at the moment. If I haven't seen people for a while then they want to know what happened to me. I'm happy to tell people the [long, gory details](http://link-to-page) but I've come to realise that it's starting to define me. I'm not just Marc, that 40-something bloke from Appleton. I quickly become Marc, the guy who nearly died and had half of his big toe cut off.

Affordances - I want them.
