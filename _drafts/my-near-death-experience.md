How do you start to tell someone that you nearly died? That your wife watched you in intensive care, fighting for your life? That on your second night in intensive care your family were told by the nurses that "you are still deteriorating despite increased support and that you are unlikely to survive"?

It's a story I never thought I'd have to tell but I've spent the past year recounting this tale to many people. They're interested yet shocked. They want to know more yet almost always squirm at the details. Most people can't believe it happened. I can't believe it happened sometimes. I've thought about how to tell people the story since I escaped the hospital wards on 18th September 2014. I'd been in hospital for around three months. On my return home, my life seemed pretty bleak but I at least I _was_ alive.

### Why am I writing about my near death experience?
There are two main reasons that I decided to write this story down. Firstly, I'm forgetting it. I woke up in the intensive treatment unit (ITU) at Warrington Hospital in late June 2014. I had no idea where I was or why I was there. It scared me. **A lot**. As I slowly moved away from death, I started to remember things. So I want some written memory of what I remember. A memory of what my wife Clare remembers. Of what people told me. Of what I did. Secondly, I've been asked what happened by many people. It can be close friends who want to know the details. It can be work colleagues who know that I was ill but don't quite know _how_ ill. It can be the woman on the train that I sparked up a conversation with and it swung to my illness, usually my fault. I wanted to be able to point them to this page and say "have a read of what happened to me and then you might understand".

So here's my story.

### Getting ill

June 2014 started of as a normal month. My son's 7th birthday in early June. My best mate Mark's annual birthday party in the middle of the month - a few beers and DJing some tunes to celebrate his 43rd birthday. On Wednesday 18th June, a train ride down to the BBC offices in London to talk about our team becoming part of the myBBC department. Post-meeting we gathered for some food at an African restaurant around the corner from Euston station. Some deliciously hot and spicy jerk chicken was devoured with some not-so-tasty, in my opinion, African ginger beer. Nothing unusual and I returned home to Warrington on the train having eaten my last solid meal.

The next day is when it started. "It" was me feeling "a bit poorly", as your mum would say. I came home from work because I was feeling intermittently hot and cold. From previous experience, this was a tell-tale sign of a stomach bug and sure enough, the evening was filled with the joy that is vomiting and diarrhoea. I texted my boss to tell him I wasn't going to be in on Friday morning as I'd been up all night. My wife Clare thought it was unusual for me to be so sick and took me to the doctor. She gave me some Dioralyte sachets to rehydrate myself with. Over the weekend I attempted to take them and to drink the classic British cure of Lucozade. I couldn't keep either down. Family plans were cancelled as I continued to be ill all weekend. Clare quickly ushered me to the doctor again on Monday morning, noting that I was having difficulty walking which seemed somewhat unusual for a case of gastroenteritis. The locum doctor was at the surgery and he examined me much more closely. Apparently touching my stomach made me cry out in pain. I have no recollection of this but it was enough for him to refer me to the Accident and Emergency department immediately.

Something wasn't right.

## Accident and emergency

This is where my memory starts to get hazy and my wife's memory takes over. She'd already taken the morning off work, having needed to drive me to the doctor's surgery, so she drove me to the Accident and Emergency department at Warrington hospital. I almost collapsed while trying to sit down in the waiting room and thankfully the doctor's referral note meant a swifter move through the triage to be seen by one of the A&E doctors. They realised that I was massively dehydrated, having not managed to keep much liquid down for nearly 5 days, and I was admitted to a ward. I was taken to a separate room rather than a ward with other patients. Understandably, you can never be too sure how contagious a patient is when you don't know what they've got. I was given intravenous (IV) fluids and left while the NHS staff looked after me and tried to determine what was wrong. Clare brought the children to visit and by Tuesday she was told that I was looking better, although she noted that I was very confused. I remember being convinced that the son of a friend of ours had been killed in a car accident. I forced her to Google it on her phone but thankfully she couldn't find anything. I'd been given morphine for the pain so this was the likely cause of my confusion but they still weren't sure what was wrong. Apparently I told the consultant that I was feeling fine and that he should send me home. He was wise enough to realise that another day in hospital was a good idea.

He probably saved my life.

## Learning to breathe, eat and walk

## Coming home

## The new normal

Prior to my illness, I had planned and was training for, the Warrington Half Marathon which took place in September 2014. As I lay in the intensive care bed, having lost most of my muscle mass and being unable to move, having been intubated and put on a ventilator which meant I was unable to speak, I kept thinking, "Will I be fit enough to run the half marathon?" Once I learnt to breathe again and was able to speak, I would often ask the nurses, in all seriousness, whether I would be able to run it. The observant amongst you will realise that the answer was a resounding "no" but it didn't stop it from being an odd goal for an intensive care patient to have. Ultimately I came to realise that it was unachievable after being as ill as I had been. In fact, I wasn't 100% sure at that point if I would ever walk again.

After the hard work of the physiotherapists at the hospital, I can now walk again, albeit for short distances at a time. Even though I've had half of my right big toe amputated and have little feeling apart from pain in both of my feet, I still have the somewhat huge goal to run a half marathon one day. Having heard about a recent colour run in Manchester, my wife Clare spotted this 3km colour run taking place for a local hospice, St. Rocco's. They provide palliative care and support for patients and their families in Warrington and have done for many years. Although I'll be unable to run the relatively short 3 kilometre run, I felt like walking this distance would be an ideal initial stepping stone towards my goal of one day running again and in doing so, I can help to raise some money for a great cause.

I'll be running it with my amazing wife Clare and our two fantastic children, Daniel and Amy. Hopefully we can have some fun getting covered in paint and helping to forget the pretty horrendous year that they, and the rest of my family, have had to endure. The children can't wait to run it and I'm happy that we're able to do something together as a family which, at this point last year, didn't seem achievable.



In June 2014, completely out of the blue, I became ill and it transpired that I had contracted streptococcus group A. This sent me into septic shock and in the space of a couple of days, I ended up being very close to death. Due to the wonderful doctors and nurses in the intensive care unit at Warrington Hospital, I managed to pull through and thankfully survived. It's been a whole year of learning to breathe, eat and walk again. In total I've had four operations to help me to deal with the aftermath of the illness. My recovery is incredibly hard at times but I've always thought of myself as a positive person, even when the going gets tough, and I try hard to never let it get me down.
