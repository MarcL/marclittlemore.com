* Teaching is hard
* You need helpers - 1 to 15 ratio of teacher to children too much
* Variety of experience
* Don't use sound on your first club
* Don't use external resources if kids can't get online
  * USB didn't work - promised Pikachu but couldn't deliver
  * Format USB for Mac and PC - Set scheme to "master boot record"
* Some children said it was fun
  * My son's friend's mum said "it was awesome, he can't wait for next week"
* Y2 - Ghost Catcher
  * Negative numbers are hard
  * Scratch doesn't fit onto a screen on smaller laptops
  * Scratch splash screen confuses children sometimes
