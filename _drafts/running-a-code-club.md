* Teaching is hard
* You need helpers - 1 to 15 ratio of teacher to children too much
* Variety of experience
* Don't use sound on your first club
* Don't use external resources if kids can't get online
  * USB didn't work - promised Pikachu but couldn't deliver
  * Format USB for Mac and PC - Set scheme to "master boot record"
* Some children said it was fun
  * My son's friend's mum said "it was awesome, he can't wait for next week"
* Y2 - Ghost Catcher
  * Negative numbers are hard
  * Scratch doesn't fit onto a screen on smaller laptops
  * Scratch splash screen confuses children sometimes
* Show & Tell - kids like to show off
* Ask questions to get the kids to answer - Rubber Duck Programming

## Projects
1. Rockband + hip-hop pikachu - Playing sounds, changing sprites depending on whether sound is playing, movement based on input
2. Ghost Catcher - Game where you click on ghosts as they appear/disappear (like "whack-a-mole"). Adding variables to remember scores, high scores and a timer. Varying the frequency, size, speed of ghosts.
3. Chatbot - Simple "AI" to respond to questions, remember answers and use them later in responses. I added a challenge here to get them to make it respond to commands. I added "hide", "moonwalk", "basketball", "dab", "bottle flip" and got the character to do the responses, random success of basketball shot, bottle flipping etc.
4. Clone Wars - [Today] Making a space shoot-em-up. Player controls, cloning sprites, enemy AI. Bonuses for adding in lives, scores, health packs, shields, extra weapons.
5. Flappy Bird - Going to make a clone of Flappy Bird game. Understanding most of what we've done before and then adding in gravity calculation and moving pipes, game states etc.
