June 2014 was a somewhat strange month. One day I was "a bit poorly", as your mum would say. The next I was being kept alive with a combination of ventilators and a cocktail of prescription drugs.

Here is my story.

## A Quick Trip To A&E

In June 2014, completely out of the blue, I became ill and it transpired that I had contracted streptococcus group A. This sent me into septic shock and in the space of a couple of days, I ended up being very close to death. Due to the wonderful doctors and nurses in the intensive care unit at Warrington Hospital, I managed to pull through and thankfully survived. It's been a whole year of learning to breathe, eat and walk again. In total I've had four operations to help me to deal with the aftermath of the illness. My recovery is incredibly hard at times but I've always thought of myself as a positive person, even when the going gets tough, and I try hard to never let it get me down.

## Learning To Walk

## The Aftermath

Prior to my illness, I had planned and was training for, the Warrington Half Marathon which took place in September 2014. As I lay in the intensive care bed, having lost most of my muscle mass and being unable to move, having been intubated and put on a ventilator which meant I was unable to speak, I kept thinking, "Will I be fit enough to run the half marathon?" Once I learnt to breathe again and was able to speak, I would often ask the nurses, in all seriousness, whether I would be able to run it. The observant amongst you will realise that the answer was a resounding "no" but it didn't stop it from being an odd goal for an intensive care patient to have. Ultimately I came to realise that it was unachievable after being as ill as I had been. In fact, I wasn't 100% sure at that point if I would ever walk again.

After the hard work of the physiotherapists at the hospital, I can now walk again, albeit for short distances at a time. Even though I've had half of my right big toe amputated and have little feeling apart from pain in both of my feet, I still have the somewhat huge goal to run a half marathon one day. Having heard about a recent colour run in Manchester, my wife Clare spotted this 3km colour run taking place for a local hospice, St. Rocco's. They provide palliative care and support for patients and their families in Warrington and have done for many years. Although I'll be unable to run the relatively short 3 kilometre run, I felt like walking this distance would be an ideal initial stepping stone towards my goal of one day running again and in doing so, I can help to raise some money for a great cause.

I'll be running it with my amazing wife Clare and our two fantastic children, Daniel and Amy. Hopefully we can have some fun getting covered in paint and helping to forget the pretty horrendous year that they, and the rest of my family, have had to endure. The children can't wait to run it and I'm happy that we're able to do something together as a family which, at this point last year, didn't seem achievable.
