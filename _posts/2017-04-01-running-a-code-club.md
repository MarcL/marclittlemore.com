Here in the UK we have an organisation called [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) which aims to help all children learn to code. It's a network of volunteers and educators who run free coding clubs for 9 to 11 year olds. I have two children, aged 7 and 9, and I want to encourage them to learn more about computing and technology and not just watching gaming videos on YouTube. When my eldest son moved from his infant school to his junior school a couple of years ago, the teachers told me how ill prepared they were for the moving to teaching programming. Having over 20 years of professional programming experience, I knew that this would be a good time to get involved in helping schools to teach programming. Unfortunately, due to [almost dying](/how-i-almost-died/), it took a bit longer to help out but I'm glad that I did. Running a Code Club is definitely harder work than I imagined but it's a fantastically rewarding experience. Here are a some lessons I have learned along the way which could help others.

## Lessons Learned In Running My Code Club

My original plan for my Code Club was to teach one group of children for around 10 weeks. I had decided to run the club only for the Y5 and Y6 pupils, ages 9 to 11, and my plan was to start with the basics and continue to build on the projects each week. When the school announced the Code Club, around 30 children enrolled so I ran the club for two 5 week periods with 15 students in each class instead.

### Teaching is hard

My wife is an English teacher of over 17 years. She laughed at me when I returned home from the first lesson and exclaimed "that was hard work". Any teachers reading this will also be laughing at my naïvety. I blindly assumed that all children would listen and implement the coding lessons I'd prepared. They did. Sometimes.

Some children will listen. Others, not so much. There's noise, there are questions, somebody needs to go to the toilet, everyone needs to go to the toilet, somebody is showing the whole class their project and so on. It's great fun but it can get chaotic. There's a great article about [embracing the chaos](https://blog.codeclub.org.uk/2016/07/13/embracing-chaos-in-your-code-club/) on the Code Club website that everyone should read.

*Tip: Embrace the chaos. It may be hard initally if you're not an educator. It gets easier and much more fun pretty quickly.*

### Class size

I had a class size of 15 children in each group. As a non-teacher, this felt like a good class size to be able to control. For the first two weeks of Code Club I was alone in teaching until another parent helper had received his DBS check. It is harder than I imagined to be able to teach a class and answer all of their questions with one teacher and 15 children. Once an additional pair of hands was on-board, it made teaching much easier and big thanks to Dan for helping every week.

*Tip: Make teaching easier by having a ratio of at least 1 adult helper to 6 or 7 children.*

### A variety of programming experience

I chose to use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) for all of my projects. It's a good choice for drag-and-drop programming and introduces the children to the basics of computer programming in simple environment, avoiding syntax errors in a language like Python or JavaScript. Most of the children had used Scratch at school but the range of abilities means that some were questioning the basics while others raced ahead adding new features. My Code Club is in the school library so I always introduce the lessons with a set of slides on the TV. I introduce the lesson and talk through the basics but then have a set of enhancements that the children could make if they have the time. I felt that this helped to set the goal for the slower students while challenging the quicker ones. I would also share my version of the game to try and challenge them to make a better project than I had.

*Tip: Consider extra features that the children could add to the project. If you're not an experienced programmer why not write a list of ideas that the children could add to your resources.*

### Preparation of lessons is key

It's perhaps an obvious point to make, especially if you're a teacher, but you should always run through the Code Club resources a couple of nights before. This helped me to understand the Code Club approach to the problem which often differed to my own. As I mentioned above, I always created a "stretch goal" for the children to try and achieve. This would often involve improving the graphics, adding start and end game screens, adding sound and any other improvements I could think of. This ended up as a fun challenge for me too.

*Tip: Run through the lesson the night before and you'll encounter any issues that the children will have before they do.*

### Using sound

I ran the "Rock Band" project on my first club. The sound of 15 computers blaring out sound effects can be tricky to manage, especially when the children find the music! Ask them to use headphones if you have them or ask them to keep the noise down.

*Tip: Projects using sound can make for a noisy classroom. Be prepared!*

### Adding more graphics

Scratch provide the children with great graphics and sound effects but they want to make it their own. For my initial Rock Band lesson I also showed them a Pikachu version as I knew seeing a Pokemon would get them engaged. I'd put the graphics on a USB stick but formatted it on my Mac. My fatal mistake was not formatting it for a FAT32 file system so it didn't work and there was some disappointment. The other issue to consider is whether the computers have internet access and whether it is allowed. You'll find that they want to download graphics from the internet to make their projects their own so you'll need to decide if this is possible. Thankfully, most schools have good safety policies and internet filtering. If the children can use their own graphics, their projects become their own.

Show the children the costume editor in Scratch and they can start creating their own sprites or variations of the existing ones. They love doing this but be aware that they will spend the whole lesson drawing if they can.

*Tip: Discuss with your school as to whether internet use is allowed by the children but allow them to get creative with their own graphics.*

### Rubber duck debugging

In software engineering we have a method of finding problems in our code known as [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). The idea is that in explaining the problem to something else, like a rubber duck, you'll actually understand the problem and will find the solution yourself. If you've never tried it before, please do. It works! The children sometimes couldn't work out why their code didn't work as expected. Instead of pointing out what was wrong, I'd ask them to explain what they've done. I'd ask questions about each line of Scratch code. Most of the children would instantly see the problem and could fix it themselves. Computer programming is all about failure. You have to get it wrong to fully understand how to correct it.

*Tip: If children have problems, ask them questions about their code. Try not to immediately offer solutions. They'll often work it out themselves.*

### Schools can't afford the best technology

I use a MacBook Pro for work. I am a developer who needs high end technology to do my job. Schools are not the same. They have constant budgetary constraints. They need to decide where to spend their hard fought for money. It won't be on the best computers. My son's school had reasonably usable Windows laptops with the latest version of Scratch on them. We generally had no issue with them. However, I helped out with teaching some programming at my daughter's infant school and it is a different story. They had half a room of desktop PCs which were usable and around 10 or 12 notebook-style laptops. These had tiny screens and missing keys. The Scratch interface didn't fit on the full screen meaning that children had to scroll up and down to add new script blocks. Some children couldn't understand how to do this.

*Tip: Check out what equipment the schools have before you start. You'll have to work with what you've got but it helps to understand the problems you may have before you start.*

### Show and tell

One of the best ideas I encorporated was to have a "show and tell" at the end of the lesson. I didn't start this until the second week but it finishes off the lesson extremely well. The children like to show their own unique take on the projects. I was often amazed at the direction the children took and it made for interesting learning for me too. Show off their projects on the big screen or projector if you have one. Make sure all of the children watch as it encourages their creativity for next time. Remember though, if you have 15 in the class, it can take quite a while to show each project. I initially gave 10 minutes to do this but ended up needing longer than that.

*Tip: Allow 15 minutes before the end of the lesson for the children to show their project to the rest of the class. They're proud of what they've done.*

### Make it fun!

Ultimately, you and the children both need to have fun. Some of the children told me that "it was awesome - I can't wait for next week". It's been a pleasure to teach them all and I hope tht I've influenced some of them to eventually follow a path into software development.

## The projects for my club

If you're interested in following a similar structure to my club, here are the projects that we did. I've also listed some of the enhancements that I added and have given links to the versions I made so you can remix them.

#### Week 1 - [Rockband](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/rock-band/)

This project gives a great basic introduction to Scratch. It shows how to playing sounds, change costumes based upon state and user input. I expanded upon it with my [Beatbox Pikachu](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/153704607/) version. Feel free to copy and remix that.

#### Week 2 - [Ghost Catcher](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/ghostbusters/)

This is a "whack-a-mole" style gme where you click on ghosts as they appear and disappear to score points. A great introduction to variables fro remembering scores and a timer. Enhancements include varying the frequency, size and speed of ghosts and adding a high score. My version shows a complete game with a game over screen. My extended Ghostbusters game is [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/153704687/).

#### Week 3 - [Chatbot](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/chatbot/)

Ths is probably my favourite project. It's a great introduction to logic by getting Scratch to ask a question and then allowing the children use the response within their code. It can start off simple but then allows them to create their own "artificial intelligence". My enhancement shows a command based AI which responds to "hide", "moonwalk", "basketball", "dab", "bottle flip" and my character responded accordingly. Bottle flipping was particularly well received! 😄 Here's [my version](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/153704739/) on the Scratch website.

#### Week 4 - [Clone Wars](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/clone-wars/)

This project was particularly enjoyed by the Y5 children in my second group. It's a space shoot-em-up with a [Galaxians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhYVcwhSWjI) like feel to it. In this you learn about cloning sprites for repeated bullets and enemy AI. I found it an interesting project to explain to the children how I would experiment with good gameplay by tweaking variables for speed of enemies, time between bullets and so on. I added some enhancements like a shield which made it feel almost like a real game. You can find my version on the Scratch website [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/153704809/).

#### Week 5 - [Flappy Parrot](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/flappy-parrot/)

This was the project that the Y6 children were most excited about. Flappy Bird is an iconic mobile game for most of them and it was great to see their ideas. It gives an introduction to gravity and also allows the idea of moving the bird forward by actually moving the pipes backwards. This was quite a mind-blowing trick for some of the children. It's great to show off game developer cheats that we often use without realising. This is also a good project to show a full set of game states with. Try adding a start and end screen. Mine used the original Flappy Bird graphics and awarded a medal if you beat the high score. You can find my version of Flappy Bird [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/153704839/).
