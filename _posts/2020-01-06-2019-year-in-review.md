I started off my 2020 by mindlessly thumbing through Twitter as I often do, and often try to avoid doing. I noticed quite a few people had written reviews or retrospectives of their 2019. Having been in software engineering for a long time now, I like the idea of the agile [sprint retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective) where you determine what went well, what could go better, and any actions for the next one. With that in mind, and inspired by [Knut Melvær](https://www.knutmelvaer.no/blog/2020/01/2019-a-personal-retrospective/), [Jason Lengstorf](https://lengstorf.com/2019-personal-retrospective/), [Justin Jackson](https://justinjackson.ca/2019-review), [Steph Smith](https://blog.stephsmith.io/another-year-under-the-sun/), and [Madison Kanna](https://www.madisonkanna.com/2019-in-review/), I present my own 2019 retrospective.

## What went well?

I'm not the sort of person who makes New Year's Resolutions at the start of the year, but I aim to have a handful of goals for the year. A lot of my free time revolves around my wife [Clare](https://clarelittlemore.com) and our two children and one of the key goals I have each year is to ensure I spend quality time with my family. We had a fantastic holiday to Disney World and Universal Studios in Florida, something we'd planned to do in 2018 but issues with my feet stopped that. Thankfully, I managed to have the toe issues before and after the holiday but walking for 5 miles in Florida a day was no problem, albeit rather humid! As everyone in the family enjoys theatre, we spent a suprising amount of times seeing musicals and plays. The children performed in four shows with their theatre group and we ended up seeing seven professional productions in London and Manchester!

Another major goal was to ensure I saw more of my friends. Once you're over 40 and have family commitments, going back to your old pre-children frivolous ways becomes less easy and your friends often drift away. I managed a couple of major get-togethers with some close of friends, one of which I don't want to repeat after the amount of gin that I drank! As we all head towards the wrong side of our 40s, I also managed to celebrate a couple of 50th birthdays too. In conjunction with seeing more of my mates, music came back into my life in a big way. I ended up seeing [The Midnight Hour](https://open.spotify.com/album/2D67AgXVKjql7tniG3jQKl) in Liverpool and meeting Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest. A big time legend from my hip-hop youth. It was also great to see the Loop Daddy himself, [Marc Rebillet](https://www.marcrebillet.com/) at Manchester's Albert Hall. If you haven't seen him then you really should. Nothing beats seeing a man in a pair of boxer shorts, a silk dressing gown, and patent leather shoes, improvising songs on a keyboard and Boss loop station. Part comedy. Part sex symbol. Part brilliant musician and singer. One of the best live shows I've seen! The final gig of the year was [Kruder & Dorfmeister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruder_%26_Dorfmeister). What I thought was going to be a chilled trip-hop experience turned into a middle-aged rave. Banging tunes and a great light show made it a fantastic night.

I've spent the last three years as a Software Engineering Team Lead at the BBC so this means I don't write much code at all during the day. Most of my technology learning happens in the evenings after the kids have gone to bed (which gets much later as they get older!). I wondered how much software development I actually did in 2019 so I had a look at my GitHub commits for the whole year. Without realising it, I managed to learn an awful lot of new technologies, most of which I hadn't touched before. These were:

* BotKit
* Google Cloud Platform
* Firebase location based API which imports data from Airtable
* Gatsby
* GraphQL
* Shopify applications and Polaris
* Spark AR
* Markdown to Mailchimp email generation (as I dislike the Mailchimp WYSIWYG editor!)
* Open Graph image generation using serverless functions
* Zeit Now 2.0 (moving a Now v1.0 API to using their new serverless functions)

I've been heavily involved in building [Messenger chatbot experiences](/bots) in the past couple of years and that enabled a lot of the frameworks and platforms in the list. Scratching your own itch is always a good way to gain more knowledge of areas you're unfamiliar with. A consulting role for a travel company in London helped me to build a chatbot solution using BotKit that deploys using Google Cloud Platform. That helped me to learn more about GCP App Engine, Cloud Firestore, and how to interface that with a location based API I build using Firebase and Airtable. A big win for me this year was deciding to refactor my wife Clare's author website using Gatsby. The previous incarnation used Wordpress and was in need of some love. Gatsby also gave me the opportunity to learn some GraphQL in the process and this led me onto some investigation of GraphQL through building some Shopify integrations for my chatbot API. This needed a bit of love this year as I'd left it to stagnate using the old Zeit Now 1.0 deployment. This used to let you deploy an Express server and spin up compute instances as needed. With their new [Zeit Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/blog/now-2) they moved over to a serverless approach but this meant the need to move each endpoint to its own function. This took a big rewrite on my part but made life easier in the long run and made my own internal API ensure it separates concerns. One thing I've noticed in listing the projects I worked on in 2019 is how one learning moment often leads to another. A problem or unknown solution in the first project often brought a discovery of a new technology which could help. I just wish I'd done more [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public) as [Shawn "SWYX" Wang](https://twitter.com/swyx) suggests.

Lastly, my work life was pretty good for most of the year. At the end of 2018, and start of 2019, I became an advocate and adviser for the BBC's ["Step Into Tech"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/29697bc8-9b32-4b41-8d42-33f1ed625859) scheme. This was a 14 week training programme to teach women from different backgrounds, the basics of software engineering. I helped to mentor four of the 2018 cohort and encouraged them to shadow our team to see what we did. We managed to get all of them to make a change, create a GitHub pull request, and deploy their changes to the live environment, something they should all be proud of. I ended up spending a lot of 2019 attempting to hire great developer for our team. By the end of the year I'd interviewed and hired five fantastic software engineers and big thanks to my team for their help and support in this. A highlight of my working year was attending the amazing [Lead Developer conference](https://theleaddeveloper.com/) in London in June 2019. As a software engineering team lead, it's much harder to see the impact you make on a team as you're less involved in writing code, raising pull requests, and merging and deploying features to your audience. This conference brought some great senior leaders together to discuss the challenges that we have. It was fantastic to hear from likeminded team leads.

## What could have gone better?

After [being incredibly ill](/how-i-almost-died) in 2014, and having a lot of knock-on health issues following my hospitalisation, I spent 2019 attempting to get more exercise. This started off reasonably well but as has happened previously, I was plagued by more issues with my toe. The amputation of my right great toe means more pressure applied to the next toe and the potential for ulcers (holes!) in it. It's a tricky balance to get more cardio exercise but avoid issue with the peripheral neuropathy in my feet. My habit tracker showed that I spent 26% of my year exercising. I should have spent more time cycling to avoid major impact on my feet but I didn't prioritise this. Time to get better in 2020.

As a [Messenger chatbot expert](/bots), I acted as a consultant for a London based travel company based in London at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. This was a side-project which I hoped would lead to more consultancy work. Although it was a great learning exercise, I ended up doing a lot of extra work, and ended up being left with unpaid invoices due to a lack of money from the startup. I had a similar experience in 2018 in which I created many prototypes for an entrepreneur in America and no payment ever materialised. Lessons learned from these experiences and it's time to build my own future in 2020.
