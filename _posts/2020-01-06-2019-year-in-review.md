I started off my 2020 by mindlessly thumbing through Twitter as I often do, and often try to avoid doing. I noticed quite a few people had written reviews or retrospectives of their 2019. Having been in software engineering for a long time now, I like the idea of the agile [sprint retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective) where you determine what went well, what could go better, and any actions for the next one. With that in mind, and inspired by [Knut Melvær](https://www.knutmelvaer.no/blog/2020/01/2019-a-personal-retrospective/), [Jason Lengstorf](https://lengstorf.com/2019-personal-retrospective/), [Justin Jackson](https://justinjackson.ca/2019-review), [Steph Smith](https://blog.stephsmith.io/another-year-under-the-sun/), and [Madison Kanna](https://www.madisonkanna.com/2019-in-review/), I present my own 2019 retrospective.

## What went well?

I don't really make New Year's Resolutions as some people do at the start of the year, but I aim to have a few goals for each year. A lot of my free time revolves around my wife [Clare](https://clarelittlemore.com) and our two children and one of the key goals I have each year is to ensure I spend quality time with my family. We had a fantastic holiday to Disney World and Universal Studios in Florida, something we'd planned to do in 2018 but issues with my feet stopped that. Thankfully, I managed to have the toe issues before and after the holiday but walking for 5 miles in Florida a day was no problem, albeit rather humid! As everyone in the family really enjoys theatre, we spent a suprising amount of times seeing musicals and plays. The children performed in four shows with their theatre group and we ended up seeing seven professional productions in London and Manchester!

Another major goal was to ensure I saw more of my friends. Once you're over 40 and have family commitments, going back to your old pre-children frivolous ways becomes less easy and your friends often drift away. I managed a couple of major get-togethers with some close of friends, one of which I don't want to repeat after the amount of gin that I drank! As we all head towards the wrong side of our 40s, I also managed to celebrate a couple of 50th birthdays too. In conjunction with seeing more of my mates, music came back into my life in a big way. I ended up seeing [The Midnight Hour](https://open.spotify.com/album/2D67AgXVKjql7tniG3jQKl) in Liverpool and meeting Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest. A big time legend from my hip-hop youth. It was also great to see the Loop Daddy himself, [Marc Rebillet](https://www.marcrebillet.com/) at Manchester's Albert Hall. If you haven't seen him then you really should. Nothing beats seeing a man in a pair of boxer shorts, a silk dressing gown, and patent leather shoes, improvising songs on a keyboard and Boss loop station. Part comedy. Part sex symbol. Part brilliant musician and singer. One of the best live shows I've seen! The final gig of the year was [Kruder & Dorfmeister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruder_%26_Dorfmeister). What I thought was going to be a chilled trip-hop experience turned into a middle-aged rave. Banging tunes and a great light show made it a fantastic night.

I've spent the last three years as a Software Engineering Team Lead at the BBC so this means I don't write much code nowadays. Most of my technology learning is done at home after the kids have gone to bed (which gets much later as they get older!) but I did attend the amazing [Lead Developer conference](https://theleaddeveloper.com/) in London in June. I wondered how much extra learning I did in the evenings so I had a look at the GitHub commits I'd done over the year. I was quite amazed at the amount of learning I did without realising it.

## What could have gone better?

After [being very ill](/how-i-almost-died) in 2014 and having a lot of knock-on health issues, I spent 2019 attempting to get more exercise. This started off reasonably well but then I was plagued by another issue with my toe. It's a tricky balance to get more cardio exercise but avoid issue with feet which are prone to problems. My habit tracker told me I spent 26% of my days exercising, only a quarter of the year. Time to get better next year.
