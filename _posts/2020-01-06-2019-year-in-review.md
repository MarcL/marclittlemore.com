I started my 2020 by thumbing through Twitter as I often do, and often try to avoid doing. Between the technology and political tweets were personal 2019 reviews and retrospectives.
In software development, we use the idea of the [agile sprint retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)). A sprint is a period of time in which you attempt to produce new features for your software application. A sprint retrospective is a team meeting when you discuss how the last sprint went. What went well, what could have gone better, and any actions to make sprints better. These personal reviews took this idea and applied it to their lives. Here is my personal 2019 retrospective.

## What went well?

One of my big goals every year is to spend quality time with [Clare](https://clarelittlemore.com) and our children. This year, we had a fantastic holiday to Disney World and Universal Studios in Florida. We planned to go in 2018 but issues with my feet changed our plans. While I had some toe issues before and after the holiday, we managed to walk for five miles on most days. A fantastic holiday! As the family loves theatre, we saw a surprising amount of musicals and plays throughout the year. The children also performed in four shows and I'm proud of how far they've come with their acting and singing.


Another major goal was to ensure I saw more of my friends. Once you hit your 40s, you end up with more family commitments so seeing old friends becomes harder. This year I had two major get-togethers with a great group of mates. The first one involved far too much gin! As we all head towards the wrong side of our 40s, I also managed to celebrate a couple of 50th birthdays. Music has always been a major part of my life and I saw more live music in 2019. Thanks to some tickets for my birthday, I saw [The Midnight Hour](https://open.spotify.com/album/2D67AgXVKjql7tniG3jQKl) in Liverpool. This ended with us meeting Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest. A big-time legend from my hip-hop youth. It was also great to see the Loop Daddy himself, [Marc Rebillet](https://www.marcrebillet.com/) at Manchester’s Albert Hall in November. If you don't know who he is then look him up. Seeing a man improvising songs in a pair of boxer shorts, a silk dressing gown, and patent leather shoes is something to behold. Part comedy. Part sex symbol. Yet he's a brilliant musician and singer. One of the best live shows I’ve seen! The final gig of the year was [Kruder & Dorfmeister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruder_%26_Dorfmeister). What I thought was going to be a chilled trip-hop experience turned into a middle-aged rave. Banging tunes and a great light show made it a fantastic night.

For the past three years, I've been a Software Engineering Team Lead at the BBC. This means that I build and manage high performing teams and don't write much code during the day any more. Most of my technology learning happens in the evenings after the kids have gone to bed (which gets much later as they get older!). I wondered how much software I wrote in 2019 so I had a look at my GitHub commits for the whole year. I surprised myself with the amount of new technologies I picked up, most of which I hadn't touched before. These were:

* BotKit
* Google Cloud Platform
* Firebase location-based API which imports data from Airtable
* Gatsby
* GraphQL
* Shopify applications and Polaris
* Spark AR
* Markdown to Mailchimp email generation (as I dislike the Mailchimp WYSIWYG editor!)
* Open Graph image generation using serverless functions
* Zeit Now 2.0 (moving a Now v1.0 API to use their new serverless functions)
* Firebase serverless function to scrape Amazon book rankings

"Scratching your own itch" is always a good way to gain more knowledge of areas you're unfamiliar with. Since 2018 I've become an expert in building [Messenger chatbot experiences](/bots) and I've often used chatbot platforms like Chatfuel to build them. As I was consulting for a Messenger based travel company, they were looking for cheaper options. This led me to build a solution using BotKit hosted using Google Cloud Platform. This was a fantastic learning experience for GCP App Engine, Cloud Firestore. It also allowed me to create a location-based API using Firebase functions and Airtable. Unfortunately, the chatbot isn't yet live due to a lack of money from the company involved. See also "what didn't go well"!

A big win for me this year was deciding to refactor my wife Clare's author website using Gatsby. The previous incarnation used Wordpress and needed some love. Gatsby also allowed me to learn some GraphQL in the process. This led me to build some Shopify integrations for my chatbot API and understand their integration. My chatbot API needed a bit of love this year as I'd left it to stagnate using the old Zeit Now 1.0 framework. This lets you deploy an Express server and spin up compute instances as needed. Zeit used to host the whole API this way. With their new [Zeit Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/blog/now-2), they pivoted to a serverless approach. The advantage of this allows the API to scale on a per endpoint basis. Yet, this requires a separate function for each API endpoint. While this was a big rewrite on my part, it made my application API much simpler. One observation I have of my 2019 project is that one learning moment leads to another. A problem or unknown solution in the first project often brought a discovery of a new technology which could help. I just wish I'd done more [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public) as [Shawn "SWYX" Wang](https://twitter.com/swyx) suggests.

My work life was pretty good for most of the year. The BBC launched one of its big diversity initiatives - the ["Step Into Tech"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/29697bc8-9b32-4b41-8d42-33f1ed625859) scheme and I became an advocate and advisor for this. It was a 14-week training programme to teach the basics of software engineering to women who were looking for a career change. I helped to mentor four of the 2018 cohort and encouraged them to shadow our team to see what we did. With the help of a senior engineer, all four women made a change to our codebase. They deployed their changes to our live applications, something they should be proud of. One of the women joined us in September, and it's been rewarding to mentor and guide her new journey. I also ended up spending a lot of 2019 hiring building up my engineering team. By the end of the year, I'd interviewed and hired four fantastic software engineers. Big thanks to my team for their help and support in this. A highlight of my working year was attending the amazing [Lead Developer conference](https://theleaddeveloper.com/) in London in June 2019. As a software engineering team lead, it's much harder to see the impact you make on a team as you no longer write code. This brought together some excellent speakers from the engineering teams across the world. It was fantastic to hear presentations from likeminded team leads, and to hear the challenges of building high functioning teams.

One of my biggest wins of the year was to use a habit tracker, a Google Sheet, to see where I was spending my time. I've found it tricky to stick to a regular reading schedule but recording when I read, I tricked myself into reading more. I finished ten books in 2019 so that's a personal win for me.

## What could have gone better?

After [being incredibly ill](/how-i-almost-died) in 2014, and having a lot of knock-on health issues following my hospitalisation, I spent 2019 attempting to get more exercise. This began reasonably well but as has happened previously, I was plagued by more issues with my toe. The amputation of my right great toe means more pressure applied to the next toe and the potential for ulcers (holes!) in it. It's a tricky balance to get more cardio exercise but avoid an issue with the peripheral neuropathy in my feet. My habit tracker showed that I spent 26% of my year exercising. I should have spent more time cycling to avoid any major impact on my feet but I didn't prioritise this. Time to get better in 2020.

As a [Messenger chatbot expert](/bots), I acted as a consultant for a London based travel company based in London at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. This was a side-project which I hoped would lead to more consultancy work. Although it was a great learning exercise, I ended up doing a lot of extra work which left me with unpaid invoices due to a lack of money from the startup. I had a similar experience in 2018 in which I created a few prototypes for an entrepreneur in America and no payment ever materialised. Lessons learned from these experiences and it's time to build my future in 2020.

I wanted to build up a writing habit as well as reading more but I failed spectacularly at this. I was proud of the fact that I wrote and released a 30-page ebook about JSON for the chatbot community but it was one of the few things I wrote all year. You can download my free [Chatfuel Chatbot JSON Guide](/bots/sign-up-bot-building-for-beginners/) if you want to.

Since late 2018 I've had plans to write an online course and hopefully make a little bit of income on the side from it. Although the JSON guide is used to guide people onto my mailing list, I've still not properly planned any course. 2020 will be the year I do this.

## Plans for 2020

My main goal is being addressed by this blog post as I plan to write a lot more in 2020. It's something I've always thought I wasn't very good at, even though I write a lot for work. The plan is to write a lot more blog posts and do a lot more [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public). I'm going to write about the technologies I'm learning about amongst other things.

As 2019 wasn't a great year for fitness, I'm planning on doing more this year. As I enjoy cycling, I'm going to get outside more on my mountain bike, both alone and with the family. I'm also trying to get the family into a regular habit of getting outside to walk more. We live near some beautiful countryside and it seems a shame not to see more of it.

Since stomach surgery in 2014, I've had a harder relationship with food. I love cooking and have always enjoyed eating great food but I struggle to eat reasonable portions. I'm often sick after eating and I find meat more difficult to digest. I've always had a meat and vegetable diet but 2020 will see me eating a more vegetarian and vegan diet - flexitarian as they seem to call it now! 

I want to get some traction on my side projects in 2020 and aim to make more of a side income through it. I'll be publishing [more videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/marclittlemore) on YouTube and this should help to drive more traffic to my website. I want to publish a short course in the first quarter of 2020 so I'll be doing some research in the next couple of weeks.

As well as spending more time with the family, I want to get back to some of my old hobbies. I've got a goal to read twenty books in 2020, doubling my rate of reading from last year. I also want to resurrect my old love of making music. I've not made any new tracks since the early 2010s so it's time to dust off the audio interface and MIDI keyboard and get back to making electronic music. I might even dust off the decks and get [DJ Cruze](http://www.djcruze.co.uk) rocking the house again!

I look forward to reviewing these goals in 2021 to see which I managed to achieve. Let's hope it's all of them.
