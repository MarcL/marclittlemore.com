I started off my 2020 by thumbing through Twitter as I often do, and often try to avoid doing. Between the technology and political tweets were personal 2019 reviews and retrospectives. Having been in software engineering for a long time now, we use the idea of the agile [sprint retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective). For those that don't know, a sprint is a time-boxed period in which you attempt to produce new features for your software application. A sprint retrospective is a team meeting in which you determine what went well and what could have gone better in the previous sprint, and any actions to take forward to the next sprint. These personal reviews took this idea and applied it to their lives. With that in mind, and inspired by [Knut Melv√¶r](https://www.knutmelvaer.no/blog/2020/01/2019-a-personal-retrospective/), [Jason Lengstorf](https://lengstorf.com/2019-personal-retrospective/), [Justin Jackson](https://justinjackson.ca/2019-review), [Steph Smith](https://blog.stephsmith.io/another-year-under-the-sun/), and [Madison Kanna](https://www.madisonkanna.com/2019-in-review/), I present my personal 2019 retrospective.

## What went well?

I'm not the sort of person who makes New Year's Resolutions at the start of the year, but I aim to have a handful of goals for the year. A lot of my free time revolves around my wife [Clare](https://clarelittlemore.com) and our two children and one of the key goals I have each year is to ensure I spend quality time with my family. We had a fantastic holiday to Disney World and Universal Studios in Florida, something we'd planned to do in 2018 but issues with my feet stopped that. Thankfully, I managed to have the toe issues before and after the holiday but walking for 5 miles in Florida a day was no problem, albeit rather humid! As everyone in the family enjoys theatre, we spent a surprising amount of times seeing musicals and plays. The children performed in four shows with their theatre group and we ended up seeing seven professional productions in London and Manchester!

Another major goal was to ensure I saw more of my friends. Once you're over 40 and have family commitments, going back to your old pre-children frivolous ways becomes less easy and your friends often drift away. I managed a couple of major get-togethers with some close of friends, one of which I don't want to repeat after the amount of gin that I drank! As we all head towards the wrong side of our 40s, I also managed to celebrate a couple of 50th birthdays too. In conjunction with seeing more of my mates, music came back into my life in a big way. I ended up seeing [The Midnight Hour](https://open.spotify.com/album/2D67AgXVKjql7tniG3jQKl) in Liverpool and meeting Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest. A big-time legend from my hip-hop youth. It was also great to see the Loop Daddy himself, [Marc Rebillet](https://www.marcrebillet.com/) at Manchester's Albert Hall. If you haven't seen him then you really should. Nothing beats seeing a man in a pair of boxer shorts, a silk dressing gown, and patent leather shoes, improvising songs on a keyboard and Boss loop station. Part comedy. Part sex symbol. Part brilliant musician and singer. One of the best live shows I've seen! The final gig of the year was [Kruder & Dorfmeister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruder_%26_Dorfmeister). What I thought was going to be a chilled trip-hop experience turned into a middle-aged rave. Banging tunes and a great light show made it a fantastic night.

I've spent the last three years as a Software Engineering Team Lead at the BBC so this means I don't write much code at all during the day. Most of my technology learning happens in the evenings after the kids have gone to bed (which gets much later as they get older!). I wondered how much software I wrote in 2019 so I had a look at my GitHub commits for the whole year. Without realising it, I managed to learn an awful lot of new technologies, most of which I hadn't touched before. These were:

* BotKit
* Google Cloud Platform
* Firebase location-based API which imports data from Airtable
* Gatsby
* GraphQL
* Shopify applications and Polaris
* Spark AR
* Markdown to Mailchimp email generation (as I dislike the Mailchimp WYSIWYG editor!)
* Open Graph image generation using serverless functions
* Zeit Now 2.0 (moving a Now v1.0 API to use their new serverless functions)

I've been heavily involved in building [Messenger chatbot experiences](/bots) in the past couple of years and that enabled a lot of the frameworks and platforms in the list. "Scratching your own itch" is always a good way to gain more knowledge of areas you're unfamiliar with. A consulting role for a travel company in London helped me to build a chatbot solution using BotKit that deploys using Google Cloud Platform. That helped me to learn more about GCP App Engine, Cloud Firestore, and how to interface that with a location-based API I build using Firebase and Airtable. A big win for me this year was deciding to refactor my wife Clare's author website using Gatsby. The previous incarnation used Wordpress and needed some love. Gatsby also allowed me to learn some GraphQL in the process and this led me onto some investigation of GraphQL through building some Shopify integrations for my chatbot API. This needed a bit of love this year as I'd left it to stagnate using the old Zeit Now 1.0 deployment. This used to let you deploy an Express server and spin up compute instances as needed. With their new [Zeit Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/blog/now-2), they moved over to a serverless approach but this meant the need to move each endpoint to a separate function. This took a big rewrite on my part but made life easier in the long run and made my internal API ensure it separates concerns. One thing I've noticed in listing the projects I worked on in 2019 is how one learning moment often leads to another. A problem or unknown solution in the first project often brought a discovery of a new technology which could help. I just wish I'd done more [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public) as [Shawn "SWYX" Wang](https://twitter.com/swyx) suggests.

Lastly, my work life was pretty good for most of the year. At the end of 2018, and the start of 2019, I became an advocate and adviser for the BBC's ["Step Into Tech"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/29697bc8-9b32-4b41-8d42-33f1ed625859) scheme. This was a 14-week training programme to teach women from different backgrounds, the basics of software engineering. I helped to mentor four of the 2018 cohort and encouraged them to shadow our team to see what we did. We managed to get all of them to make a change, create a GitHub pull request, and deploy their changes to the live environment, something they should all be proud of. I ended up spending a lot of 2019 attempting to hire a great developer for our team. By the end of the year, I'd interviewed and hired five fantastic software engineers and big thanks to my team for their help and support in this. A highlight of my working year was attending the amazing [Lead Developer conference](https://theleaddeveloper.com/) in London in June 2019. As a software engineering team lead, it's much harder to see the impact you make on a team as you're less involved in writing code, raising pull requests, and merging and deploying features to your audience. This conference brought some great senior leaders together to discuss the challenges that we have. It was fantastic to hear from likeminded team leads.

Lastly, one of the biggest wins was to spend more time reading in 2019. I've found it tricky to stick to a regular reading schedule but by keeping a habit tracker, I tricked myself into reading more. I finished ten books in 2019 so that's a personal win for me.

## What could have gone better?

After [being incredibly ill](/how-i-almost-died) in 2014, and having a lot of knock-on health issues following my hospitalisation, I spent 2019 attempting to get more exercise. This began reasonably well but as has happened previously, I was plagued by more issues with my toe. The amputation of my right great toe means more pressure applied to the next toe and the potential for ulcers (holes!) in it. It's a tricky balance to get more cardio exercise but avoid an issue with the peripheral neuropathy in my feet. My habit tracker showed that I spent 26% of my year exercising. I should have spent more time cycling to avoid any major impact on my feet but I didn't prioritise this. Time to get better in 2020.

As a [Messenger chatbot expert](/bots), I acted as a consultant for a London based travel company based in London at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. This was a side-project which I hoped would lead to more consultancy work. Although it was a great learning exercise, I ended up doing a lot of extra work which left me with unpaid invoices due to a lack of money from the startup. I had a similar experience in 2018 in which I created a few prototypes for an entrepreneur in America and no payment ever materialised. Lessons learned from these experiences and it's time to build my future in 2020.

I wanted to build up a writing habit as well as reading more but I failed spectacularly at this. I was proud of the fact that I wrote and released a 30-page ebook about JSON for the chatbot community but it was one of the few things I wrote all year. You can download my free [Chatfuel Chatbot JSON Guide](/bots/sign-up-bot-building-for-beginners/) if you want to.

Since late 2018 I've had plans to write an online course and hopefully make a little bit of income on the side from it. Although the JSON guide is used to guide people onto my mailing list, I've still not properly planned any course. 2020 will be the year I do this.

## Plans for 2020

My main goal is being addressed by this blog post as I plan to write a lot more in 2020. It's something I've always thought I wasn't very good at, even though I write a lot for work. The plan is to write a lot more blog posts and do a lot more [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public). I'm going to write about the technologies I'm learning about amongst other things.

As 2019 wasn't a great year for fitness, I'm planning on doing more this year. As I enjoy cycling, I'm going to get outside more on my mountain bike, both alone and with the family. I'm also trying to get the family into a regular habit of getting outside to walk more. We live near some beautiful countryside and it seems a shame not to see more of it.

Since stomach surgery in 2014, I've had a harder relationship with food. I love cooking and have always enjoyed eating great food but I struggle to eat reasonable portions. I'm often sick after eating and I find meat more difficult to digest. I've always had a meat and vegetable diet but 2020 will see me eating a more vegetarian and vegan diet - flexitarian as they seem to call it now! 

I want to get some traction on my side projects in 2020 and aim to make more of a side income through it. I'll be publishing [more videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/marclittlemore) on YouTube and this should help to drive more traffic to my website. I want to publish a short course in the first quarter of 2020 so I'll be doing some research in the next couple of weeks.

As well as spending more time with the family, I want to get back to some of my old hobbies. I've got a goal to read twenty books in 2020, doubling my rate of reading from last year. I also want to resurrect my old love of making music. I've not made any new tracks since the early 2010s so it's time to dust off the audio interface and MIDI keyboard and get back to making electronic music. I might even dust off the decks and get [DJ Cruze](http://www.djcruze.co.uk) rocking the house again!

I look forward to reviewing these goals in 2021 to see which I managed to achieve. Let's hope it's all of them.
