I'm Marc Littlemore. I'm a software engineer, a veteran of the video games industry with 18 years of games programming experience, a house music [DJ](http://www.djcruze.co.uk) since 1988, an occasional [house music producer](http://soundcloud.com/djcruze) and lover of technology. I'm a husband to my fantastic wife [Clare](http://www.chlittle.com) and have two beautiful children.

I also nearly died after contracting a streptococcal infection in June 2014. I'll tell you more about that later.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/marclittlemore), on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/MarcL) and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marclittlemore).

I currently work as a Principal Software Engineer at the BBC. Any views expressed here are my own and not those of the BBC. I originally came to the BBC to help with their global games strategy in order to enable third party developers to make games more easily for the BBC. However, my focus has ended up shifting and I'm now working with an amazing team in producing a more personal BBC experience. Phil Fearnley, the Director of myBBC, has written a great [blog post](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/entries/46a896ea-e587-4c63-ae7e-9781bca58dd3) which will tell you more about our plans. We decided to use a JavaScript stack with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and this has been a great move with some interesting problems and challenges. We're always looking for talented people to join our team so if you're a great software engineer then send me a tweet!
