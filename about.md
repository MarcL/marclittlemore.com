I'm Marc Littlemore. I'm a software engineer, ex-video games programmer, DJ, house music producer and technology tinkerer.

I also nearly died in 2014. I'll tell you more about that later.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/marclittlemore), on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/MarcL) and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marclittlemore).

I currently work as a Principal Software Engineer at the BBC. Any views expressed here are my own and not those of the BBC.
