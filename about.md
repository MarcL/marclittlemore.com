I'm Marc Littlemore. I'm a software engineer, a veteran of the video games industry with 18 years of games programming experience, a house music [DJ](http://www.djcruze.co.uk) since 1988, an occasional [house music producer](http://soundcloud.com/djcruze) and lover of technology. I'm a husband to my fantastic wife [Clare](http://www.chlittle.com) and have two beautiful children.

I also nearly died in 2014. I'll tell you more about that later.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/marclittlemore), on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/MarcL) and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marclittlemore).

I currently work as a Principal Software Engineer at the BBC. Any views expressed here are my own and not those of the BBC. I originally came to the BBC to help with their global games strategy in order to help third party developers to make games more easily for the BBC. However, my focus has ended up shifiting and I'm now working with an amazing team  to help to produce a more personal BBC. Phil Fearnley's great [blog post](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/entries/46a896ea-e587-4c63-ae7e-9781bca58dd3) will tell you more. We've switched over to using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) which has been a great move with some interesting problems and challenged. We're always looking for talented people to join our team so if you're interested then send me a tweet!

I've worked on many projects over the years, both personal and for the companies I've worked for. Here are some of the highlights.

### Minipenny Limited (2010-2014)
