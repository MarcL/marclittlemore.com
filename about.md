I'm Marc Littlemore. I'm a software engineer, a veteran of the video games industry with 18 years of games programming experience, a house music [DJ](http://www.djcruze.co.uk) since 1988, an occasional [house music producer](http://soundcloud.com/djcruze) and lover of technology. I'm a husband to my fantastic wife [Clare](http://www.chlittle.com) and have two beautiful children.

I also nearly died in 2014. I'll tell you more about that later.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/marclittlemore), on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/MarcL) and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marclittlemore).

I currently work as a Principal Software Engineer at the BBC. Any views expressed here are my own and not those of the BBC.
