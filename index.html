        Hello, Iâ€™m <strong>Marc Littlemore</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="f3">
        I've been a developer since the early 1990s. I spent 20 years writing videogames and I'm now building large scale web applications at the BBC. I love <a href="/talks" alt="Talks">public speaking</a> and I've recently become an expert on Messenger marketing using chatbots. I'm teaching people how to build better chatbots with my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDvWRKT9Cd2g-L4_hStYOcmOfTF87U8FM" target="_blank">YouTube videos</a> and my goal is to help more people to learn how to build amazing conversational commerce using them. <a href="/bots/sign-up-bot-building-for-beginners/">Want to learn more about chatbots?</a>
