I've been a professional software engineer since 1993 and I now build high performing engineering teams. I love software development and like to [write about it](/articles). 

_I love to learn and teach others what I know._

I can teach you more about [JavaScript testing](/javascript-testing) and [chatbot development](/bots). If you want to know more then you should also follow my journey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marclittlemore).
