The main focus of my life right now is:

* Helping my wife [Clare](http://www.clarelittlemore.com) to realise her dreams of becoming a full-time writer and online teacher
* Writing a course on mobile games and app development using Unity
* Continuing to recover from a major illness and write about it to help others. You can read about it on Clare's new blog [Out Of The Woods](http://outofthewoodsblog.com)
* Starting to [write every day](http://goinswriter.com/write-every-day), a skill which I think I need to practice as it's something I'm a little bit scared of
* Bringing up, and playing with, my two amazing children and helping them to grow up to be inspired human beings.
