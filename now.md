The main focus of my life right now is:

* Fixing some broken computers.
* Building a course to help people to learn something computer related. I'm not quite sure what area to concentrate my efforts on so this month will be working that out.
* Helping my wife [Clare](http://www.clarelittlemore.com) to realise her dreams of becoming a full-time writer and online teacher.
* Continuing to recover from a major illness and write about it to help others. You can read about it on Clare's new blog [Out Of The Woods](http://outofthewoodsblog.com).
* Bringing up, and playing with, my two amazing children and helping them to grow up to be inspired human beings.
