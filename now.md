These are things that I am focussed on right now:

* Bringing up and playing with my two amazing children and helping them to grow up to be inspired human beings
* Helping my wife [Clare](http://www.chlittle.com) to realise her dreams of being a full-time writer with lots of technical help where needed
* Writing a course on writing mobile games and apps using Unity
* [Writing every day](http://goinswriter.com/write-every-day), a skill which I think I need to practice as it's something I'm a little bit scared of
* Continuing to recover from a major illness and write about it to help others. You can read about it on Clare's new blog [Out Of The Woods](http://outofthewoodsblog.com)
