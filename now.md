These are things that I'm doing at the moment:

* Playing with my two amazing children and helping them to grow up to be inspired human beings
* Helping my wife [Clare](http://www.chlittle.com) to realise her dreams of being a writer
* Finishing my current side-project: "What The Book" - an iOS book quiz game
* Learning more about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) by writing this blog
* Actually blogging a bit more!
* Recovering from a major illness and writing about it to help others
