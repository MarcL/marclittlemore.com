<p class="f4">I'm Marc Littlemore. I'm a software engineer, a veteran of the video games industry with 18 years of games programming experience, <a href="http://www.djcruze.co.uk">a house music DJ</a> since 1988, an occasional <a href="http://soundcloud.com/djcruze">house music producer</a>, Messenger marketing and chatbot builder, and lover of technology. I'm a husband to my fantastic wife <a href="http://www.clarelittlemore.com">Clare</a> and have two beautiful children.</p>

I also nearly died from multiple organ failure due to sepsis after contracting a streptococcal infection in June 2014. I've written a brief version of [how I nearly died](/how-i-almost-died/) so please take a look if you wonder what happened. Obviously I'm still here but you can read about what happened and how our lives have changed. My wife Clare is blogging about our experience of my illness in more detail so you should probably read it on her [Out Of The Woods Blog](http://outofthewoodsblog.com).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/marclittlemore) for occasional wit and games and coding links, on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/MarcL) for my code, and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marclittlemore) for photos.

I currently work as a Principal Software Engineer at the BBC, although I have a 20+ years of development experience, mainly in the video games industry. I originally came to the BBC to help with their global games strategy in order to enable third party developers to make games more easily for the BBC. However, my focus has ended up shifting and I'm now working with the  amazing myBBC team in producing a more personal BBC experience.

If you want to know what games I've worked on then take a look at my non-exhaustive [game list](/games).

We're developing some high availability web applications using JavaScript on the client and server using Node.js and React. I've also become a test-driven development evangelist, encouraging the team to write solid code through testing and have recently become the security champion for the team. Although, I don't have a background in application security, it's been a great learning experience to determine how best to secure our Node applications.

Outside of work you'll find me playing with my kids and helping them to grow up to be wonderful human beings. I also spent the 25+ years DJing house music and occasionally producing dance music as [DJ Cruze](http://www.djcruze.co.uk/). That site is somewhat neglected but I might resurrect it at some point soon.
