## What you will learn

This course will be delivered to you over 7 days, with one lesson per day. You will learn a new testing technique each day, which you can spend some time trying. You can then apply it to your own JavaScript project and build your confidence of the different techniques I'll teach you. Here's what you'll learn during the week:

* The different types of tests you can write as a JavaScript developer.
* What you need to install to start unit testing your JavaScript code.
* The different types of assertions and how you should use them.
* How you can set up different test suites and group your tests for clearer output.
* How to ignore or specify single tests or test suites for debugging.
* How to test those tricksy asynchronous callback functions and promises.
* How to time travel (like Doctor Who!) using fake timers to speed up your tests.
* How to set up an example project using the GitHub API and fully test it.
* How to stub the GitHub API request to test your happy and unhappy code paths.
* A simpler way to configure your test setup.
* How to automate your tests for continuous integration.
Some ideas for better JavaScript testing to help you to level-up your skills.
