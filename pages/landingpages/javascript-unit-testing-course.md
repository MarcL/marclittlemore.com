## Want to learn how to test your JavaScript application?

Everyone tells you that you should be testing your code but when you're a beginner, and just learning about **JavaScript testing**, it can be an *overwhelming array of buzzwords and frameworks*.

* Which framework should you use?
* What are test doubles?
* Do you need to mock or stub?
* What on earth do I test?

### Most examples make JavaScript testing look pretty easy

The examples that you find online are often very simplified and don't show you what and how to test a production-ready application. Often the tutorials show you how to unit test a calculator!

> "Expect 2 + 2 to equal 4. That's great but how do I test my Express application talks to the Twitter API?"

Most of us are not writing calculator applications. You'll be writing a Node.js server which talks to third party APIs. You'll be taking user input and reading or writing data from or to a database. These things can often seem untestable but <span class="highlight">this course will help you to understand how and to develop JavaScript testing best practices</span>.

## What youâ€™ll learn

If you want to level up your JavaScript testing skills then you'll want to begin with the fundamentals. This course will first teach you the basics after which you can advance to design a solid test suite for a real-world product that you could charge money for. This course will not only help you to level up your JavaScript testing skills, <span class="highlight">it'll send you on your way to becoming a senior developer and will help you to increase your salary</span>.
