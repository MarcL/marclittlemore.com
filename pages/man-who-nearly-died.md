How do you start to tell someone that you nearly died? That your wife watched you in intensive care, fighting for your life? That your children nearly lost their father when he was only 42?

It's a story I never thought I'd have to tell but I've spent the past couple of years recounting this tale to many people. They're interested yet shocked. They want to know more yet almost always squirm at the details. Most people can't believe it happened. I often can't believe it happened. It feels like a really bad dream or a fly-on-the-wall documentary. I've wanted to write it down since it happened but never felt able to do it. So finally here it is: the story of how I almost died.

### The beginning

June 2014 started of as a normal month. My son's 7th birthday in early June. My best mate Mark's annual birthday party in the middle of the month which always involves a few beers and DJing some tunes to celebrate, this year being his 43rd birthday. On Wednesday 18th June, a train ride down to the BBC offices in London to talk about our team becoming part of the myBBC initiative. Post-meeting we gathered for some food at an African restaurant around the corner from Euston station. Some deliciously hot and spicy jerk chicken was devoured with some not-so-tasty, in my opinion, African ginger beer. Nothing unusual and I returned home to Warrington on the train having eaten my last solid meal in what would become a couple of months.

### The illness starts

The next day is when it started. "It" was me feeling "a bit poorly", as your mum might say. I came home from work because I was feeling intermittently hot and cold. From previous experience, this was a tell-tale sign of a stomach bug and sure enough, the evening was filled with the joy that is vomiting and diarrhoea. I texted my boss to tell him I wasn't going to be in on Friday morning as I'd been up all night throwing up. I felt terrible because I had to cancel my plans to give a lesson at his wife's school where we'd planned to teach 10 and 11 year olds how to write videogames. My wife Clare thought it was unusual for me to be so sick and took me to the doctor. The doctor gave me some Dioralyte sachets to rehydrate myself with and sent me home. Over the weekend I attempted to take them and to drink lots of the classic British cure for illness, Lucozade. I couldn't keep either down. Family plans were cancelled as I continued being ill all weekend. Clare quickly ushered me to the doctor again on Monday morning, noting that I was having difficulty even walking which seemed somewhat unusual for a case of gastroenteritis. The locum doctor was at the surgery and he examined me much more closely. Apparently touching my stomach made me cry out in pain. I have no recollection of this but it was enough for him to refer me to the Accident and Emergency department immediately. The symptoms appeared more serious to him that were first imagined.

_I think he was probably the first person to save my life._

### Accident and emergency

This is where my memory starts to get hazy and my wife's memory takes over. She'd already taken the morning off work, having needed to drive me to the doctor's surgery, so she drove me to the Accident and Emergency department at Warrington hospital. I almost collapsed while trying to sit down in the waiting room and thankfully the doctor's referral note meant a swifter move through the triage to be seen by one of the A&E doctors. They realised that I was massively dehydrated, having not managed to keep much liquid down for nearly 5 days, and I was admitted to a ward. I was taken to a separate room rather than a ward with other patients. Understandably, you can never be too sure how contagious a patient is when you don't know what they've got. I was given intravenous (IV) fluids and left while the NHS staff looked after me and tried to determine what was wrong. Clare brought the children to visit and by Tuesday she was told that I was looking better, although she noted that I was very confused. I remember being convinced that the son of a friend of ours had been killed in a car accident. I forced her to Google it on her phone but thankfully she couldn't find anything. I'd been given morphine for the pain but they still weren't sure what was wrong. Apparently I told the consultant that I was feeling fine and that he should send me home. He was wise enough to realise that another day in hospital was a good idea.

_He was probably the second person to save my life._

### Then it happened...

Apparently, it all happened very fast. Clare left me at the hospital after visiting until 7pm having been told that I was doing well. She rang again at 10pm to check I was ok and the person who answered the phone said I was fine. She was then rudely awoken at 2.30am on Wednesday morning by the phonecall you never want from a hospital, "You need to come to the hospital immediately. Marc is very ill." My blood pressure had dropped through the floor. I had multi-organ failure and all of my major organs were beginning to shut down.

> "You need to come to the hospital immediately. Marc is very ill."

It seemed like I had [sepsis](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-poisoning/Pages/Introduction.aspx), a condition where the body's immune system goes into overdrive and attempts to protect itself from infection. I was rushed down for a computerised tomography (CT) scan to determine the cause of the blood poisoning. My wife had a painful wait at 4am as the CT radiologist raced to get into the hospital after being called in for this emergency procedure. They took the scan and discovered that I had a problem somewhere in my bowel but had no idea what it was. The order was given to operate that morning to investigate and potential fix the problem with my bowel. Thankfully, one of their best colorectal surgeons was on hand to perform the operation but there was no guarantee that I would survive.

### Saving my life

The operation had concluded that I had an [ischemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_colitis) bowel due to an inadequate blood supply, but the consultants were unsure what was causing it. The infected piece of bowel was removed and an ileostomy was performed, meaning that my small bowel was diverted out of my body. This was done to attempt to allow the bowel to recover but this meant I would have a stoma, an opening in my stomach through which the waste travels into a bag. Not very glamourous but at that point in time it gave the medical staff the only chance to save my life. They took a sample from my bowel and this was sent to the microbiologists in order to find the cause of the infection. I was given broad spectrum antibiotics in order to kill it but these have the side-effects of killing good bacteria too. I was then put into a medically induced coma so that my body had a better chance of coping with the drugs that I was being given.

I was [intubated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation) to prevent asphixiation. I was given [inotropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotrope) to increase the strength of my heartbeat in an attempt to keep the blood flowing properly to my quickly-dying organs. My blood was passed through a dialysis machine to clean it of the toxins that were busy attacking me. My blood pressure was dangerously low. My body was dying but I was being kept alive by the miracle of modern medicine until they could determine what was wrong. Every treatment that they were given me had the potential to cause knock-on effects elsewhere. The ITU consultant spoke to Clare and my family and told them "his condition is deteriorating, despite increased support, and he is unlikely to survive."

> His condition is deteriorating, despite increased support, and he is unlikely to survive.

_They were pretty sure I would die that night._ 

### Waking up in intensive care

## Coming home

## The new normal

Prior to my illness, I had planned and was training for, the Warrington Half Marathon which took place in September 2014. As I lay in the intensive care bed, having lost most of my muscle mass and being unable to move, having been intubated and put on a ventilator which meant I was unable to speak, I kept thinking, "Will I be fit enough to run the half marathon?" Once I learnt to breathe again and was able to speak, I would often ask the nurses, in all seriousness, whether I would be able to run it. The observant amongst you will realise that the answer was a resounding "no" but it didn't stop it from being an odd goal for an intensive care patient to have. Ultimately I came to realise that it was unachievable after being as ill as I had been. In fact, I wasn't 100% sure at that point if I would ever walk again.

After the hard work of the physiotherapists at the hospital, I can now walk again, albeit for short distances at a time. Even though I've had half of my right big toe amputated and have little feeling apart from pain in both of my feet, I still have the somewhat huge goal to run a half marathon one day. Having heard about a recent colour run in Manchester, my wife Clare spotted this 3km colour run taking place for a local hospice, St. Rocco's. They provide palliative care and support for patients and their families in Warrington and have done for many years. Although I'll be unable to run the relatively short 3 kilometre run, I felt like walking this distance would be an ideal initial stepping stone towards my goal of one day running again and in doing so, I can help to raise some money for a great cause.

I'll be running it with my amazing wife Clare and our two fantastic children, Daniel and Amy. Hopefully we can have some fun getting covered in paint and helping to forget the pretty horrendous year that they, and the rest of my family, have had to endure. The children can't wait to run it and I'm happy that we're able to do something together as a family which, at this point last year, didn't seem achievable.



In June 2014, completely out of the blue, I became ill and it transpired that I had contracted streptococcus group A. This sent me into septic shock and in the space of a couple of days, I ended up being very close to death. Due to the wonderful doctors and nurses in the intensive care unit at Warrington Hospital, I managed to pull through and thankfully survived. It's been a whole year of learning to breathe, eat and walk again. In total I've had four operations to help me to deal with the aftermath of the illness. My recovery is incredibly hard at times but I've always thought of myself as a positive person, even when the going gets tough, and I try hard to never let it get me down.

### The future

Am I better? I'm definitely much better than I was in 2014 but things will never be how they were and I've come to accept that. I've defined my "new normal" and that ultimately means that I can't do some things that I used to, or want to. But I'm still here with my family. And that's what **really** matters.
