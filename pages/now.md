This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## Currently working on

- Coping with the current Coronavirus pandemic!
- Daily excercise with [Fitness Blender](https://www.fitnessblender.com/) and [Joe Wicks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAxW1XT0iEJo0TYlRfn6rYQ).
- Making musical videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_eDfE0Y7UoUiI45xgfzpXA) with the children.
