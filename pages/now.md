This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) project. It shows you where my current focus is and is helping me to focus on the things that I think are important at this point in time.

## Current Focus

* Getting ready for Christmas with the family.
* Technical writing on this site.
* Fixing a broken mac-mini.

## Up Next
* Planning my Code Club course to help year 5 and 6 children to learn computer programming.
* Planning a course to help people to learn something computer related. I'm not sure what area to concentrate my efforts on so this month will be working that out.

## Always doing

* Bringing up, and playing with, my two amazing children and helping them to grow up to be inspired human beings.
* Helping my wife [Clare](http://www.clarelittlemore.com) to realise her dreams of becoming a full-time writer and online teacher.
* Continuing to recover from a major illness and write about it to help others. You can read about it on Clare's new blog [Out Of The Woods](http://outofthewoodsblog.com).
