This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) project. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## Currently working on

* Creating [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDvWRKT9Cd2g-L4_hStYOcmOfTF87U8FM) to help people to create interesting Chatbots.
* Writing chatbot API integrations for a couple of other people.
* Learning more about serverless architectures using Google Cloud Functions and AWS Lambda.
* Writing a PDF to show people how to build Facebook Chatbots with Chatfuel.
* Planning a course on building bots. Want to join? Signup here [JavaScript testing course]({{site.url}}/bots/sign-up-bot-building-for-beginners/).

## Always doing

* Bringing up, and playing with, my two amazing children and helping them to grow up to be inspired human beings.
* Helping my wife [Clare](http://www.clarelittlemore.com) to realise her dreams of becoming a full-time writer.
