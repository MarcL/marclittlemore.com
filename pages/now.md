This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) project. It shows you where my current focus is and is helping me to focus on the things that I think are important at this point in time.

## Current Focus

* Writing a PDF to show people how to easily build Facebook Chatbots with Chatfuel.
* Planning a course on building bots. Want to join? Signup here [JavaScript testing course]({{site.url}}/bots/sign-up-bot-building-for-beginners/).

## Up Next

* Creating chatbots for e-commerce companies.

## Always doing

* Bringing up, and playing with, my two amazing children and helping them to grow up to be inspired human beings.
* Helping my wife [Clare](http://www.clarelittlemore.com) to realise her dreams of becoming a full-time writer.
* Helping other sepsis survivors by speaking about [how I nearly died](/how-i-almost-died/). You can also read about it in more detail on Clare's new blog [Out Of The Woods](http://outofthewoodsblog.com).
