This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## Currently working on

- Sharing my [Chatfuel Chatbot JSON Guide](http://bit.ly/chatfuel-json-guide) which shows people how to use JSON with Chatfuel.
- Learning more about internet marketing and course creation.
- Creating [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDvWRKT9Cd2g-L4_hStYOcmOfTF87U8FM) to help people to create interesting Chatbots.
- Planning a course on building bots. Want to join? Sign up here for my [Chatbot Insiders]({{site.url}}/bots/sign-up-bot-building-for-beginners/) newsletter and **FREE Chatfuel Chatbot JSON Guide**.

## Always doing

- Bringing up, and playing with, my two amazing children and helping them to grow up to be inspired human beings.
- Helping my wife [Clare](http://www.clarelittlemore.com) to realise her dreams of becoming a full-time writer.
