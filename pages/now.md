This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## Currently working on

- Coping with the current Coronavirus pandemic!
- Regular excercise with [Fitness Blender](https://www.fitnessblender.com/)
- Mountain biking on an almost daily basis
- Building a geolocation service for Facebook Messenger chatbots

## Currently reading

- [Remote: Office Not Required](https://amzn.to/3hjus5e) by [David Heinemeier Hanson](https://dhh.dk/) and [Jason Fried](https://medium.com/@jasonfried)
