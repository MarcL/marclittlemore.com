This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) project. It shows you where my current focus is and is helping me to focus on the things that I think are important at this point in time.

## Current Focus

* Planning my Code Club course to help year 5 and 6 children to learn computer programming. It starts next week!
* Writing an article on unit testing JavaScript applications.
* Finishing a guide on JavaScript development environments
* Planning a course on JavaScript unit testing.

## Up Next

* Fixing a broken mac-mini.
* Filling in the dreaded tax return!

## Always doing

* Bringing up, and playing with, my two amazing children and helping them to grow up to be inspired human beings.
* Helping my wife [Clare](http://www.clarelittlemore.com) to realise her dreams of becoming a full-time writer and online teacher.
* Continuing to recover from a major illness and write about it to help others. You can read about it on Clare's new blog [Out Of The Woods](http://outofthewoodsblog.com).
