This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) project. It shows you where my current focus is and is helping me to focus on the things that I think are important at this point in time.

## Current Focus

* Writing a mini-course on JavaScript testing.
* Planning my larger [JavaScript testing course](({{site.url}}/courses/javascript-testing-made-easy)).
* Building an email list for my JavaScript testing course which you can sign up for here: [JavaScript Testing Made Easy]({{site.url}}/courses/javascript-testing-made-easy)

## Up Next

* Learning Golang.

## Always doing

* Bringing up, and playing with, my two amazing children and helping them to grow up to be inspired human beings.
* Helping my wife [Clare](http://www.clarelittlemore.com) to realise her dreams of becoming a full-time writer.
* Helping other sepsis survivors by speaking about [how I nearly died](/how-i-almost-died/). You can also read about it in more detail on Clare's new blog [Out Of The Woods](http://outofthewoodsblog.com).
