I used the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) JavaScript framework for the first time and this made it really easy to get a fun game up and running quickly. You can find [the code here](https://github.com/MarcL/see-it-off) but be warned that it was written very quickly over a few nights so don't view it as best practice for games programming!",

This was written using C# and the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) game engine. This was a great project for learning about integration of in-app payments, social network sharing and advertising networks. Unfortunately, I ended up taking the project down due to copyright claims because I was using books as the main theme for the puzzles.",

A very basic game but taught me about Unity and adding advertising networks, and automating deployment to the Apple app store.",

It taught me an awful lot about effective caching, devops and how not to write solid unit and integration tests for a project. I've learnt an awful lot about properly mocking and stubbing systems since this game!",
