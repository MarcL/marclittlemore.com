<p>Hi my friend,</p>

<p>This week I've been thinking about <a href="https://example.com/productivity">productivity tools</a> and how they can help remote teams stay connected.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ol>
<li>Communication is key in remote teams</li>
<li><a href="https://example.com/async">Asynchronous work</a> requires different strategies</li>
<li>Tools matter, but culture matters more</li>
</ol>

<p>I also came across this interesting <a href="https://example.com/article">article about engineering management</a> that I think you'll enjoy.</p>

<p>Until next week!</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>Marc</p>
