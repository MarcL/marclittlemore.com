I've been a professional software engineer since 1993 and I build and manage high performing engineering teams and applications at the BBC.

I love software development and like to [write about it](/articles). I'm building digital products and _I love to learn and teach others what I know._

I can teach you more about [JavaScript testing](/javascript-testing) and [chatbot development](/bots). If you want to know more then you should also follow my journey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marclittlemore).

Learn more [about me here](/about).
