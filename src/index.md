Hello there! 👋🏻

I'm Marc Littlemore. I'm an **Software Engineering Manager** at [Beacon](https://beacon.com).

I love helping to hire and build **diverse and inclusive** teams of software engineers who understand, and are **intentional, about remote work**. I help teams to build quality software applications whilst not being in the same office.

I regularly [write articles](/articles/) about software development, [JavaScript testing](/javascript-testing/), remote working, and technical leadership.
