Hello! I'm Marc and I'm an **Software Engineering Manager** at [Beacon](https://beacon.com).

I love helping to build diverse and inclusive teams of software engineers who understand, and are intentional, about remote work. I help them to build quality applications whilst not being in the same office. I blog about software development, [JavaScript testing](/javascript-testing/) and technical leadership.
