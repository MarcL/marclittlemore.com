title: Hello, I'm Marc Littlemore
subtitle: I help people to profit through automation
---

I've been a professional software engineer since 1993 and I build and manage high performing software engineering teams at the BBC.

I use my software development skills to help people to make more money by automating their marketing using [chatbots](/bots).

I also teach developers how to level up their careers by learning how to properly [test their code](/javascript-testing).
