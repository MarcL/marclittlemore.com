ðŸ‘‹ This is a first note to test whether I can start a microblog on my website. The aim is to post once and and syndicate the content to multiple social media platforms following the [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) idea - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.

Let's see if this works!
