Hey! I'm Marc Littlemore. :wave:

I'm a software engineer, a veteran of the video games industry with 18 years of games programming experience, [a house music DJ](https://www.djcruze.co.uk) since 1988, a [house music producer](https://soundcloud.com/djcruze), Messenger marketing and [chatbot builder](/bots/), and lover of technology. I'm a husband to my fantastic wife [Clare](https://clarelittlemore.com) and we have two wonderful children.

My current role is as a Software Engineering Manager at [Beacon](https://beacon.com), although I started my software development journey in 1993 in the video games industry. I moved to the BBC in 2013 to help with their global games strategy to simplify third party developers integration with BBC gaming technologies. In 2015, my focus shifted and I helped to architect and build the audience-facing authentication and authorisation systems, otherwise known as [BBC Account](https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/account/). In 2021, I moved on from the BBC and worked for a B2B telecoms company for a short while before moving on to a modern digital software company. I now build diverse and inclusive software teams as a Software Engineering Manager at Beacon, helping to modernise digital supply chains with my team. 

I also nearly died from multiple organ failure due to sepsis after contracting a streptococcal infection in June 2014. I've written a brief version of [how I nearly died](/how-i-almost-died/) so please take a look if you wonder what happened. Obviously I'm still here but you can read about what happened and how our lives have changed. My wife Clare is blogging about our experience of my illness in more detail so you should probably read it on her [Out Of The Woods Blog](http://outofthewoodsblog.com).

You should follow my journey on [Twitter]({{socialMedia.twitter.url}}) as I start to build and document how I build my online business.

You'll find my code on [GitHub]({{socialMedia.github.url}}) and I sometimes post photos on [Instagram]({{socialMedia.instagram.url}}).

If you want to know what games I've worked on then take a look at my non-exhaustive [game list](/games).

My team develops high availability web applications using JavaScript on the client and server using Node.js and React. I've also become a test-driven development evangelist, encouraging the team to write solid code through [testing](/javascript-testing).

Outside of work you'll find me playing with my kids and helping them to grow up to be wonderful human beings. I also spent the 25+ years DJing house music and producing house music as [DJ Cruze](https://www.djcruze.co.uk/). The site has recently been rebuilt using my favourite static site generator, [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).
