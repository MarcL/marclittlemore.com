Hello! I'm Marc Littlemore. :wave:

I'm a Senior Software Engineering Manager at [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

I love building diverse and inclusive software engineering team and love [lifting people up](/lift-your-team-up/).

I really enjoy helping people like you learn to be a better [intentional technical leaders](/newsletter/).

## I've been around

I'm a veteran (old!) software engineer and started my love for computers when our family got a Commodore Vic-20 back in the early 80s. I spent my teenage years programming BASIC on various home computers and ended up at Manchester University from 1990 to 1993 studying Computer Science.

I spent a year writing gas chromatography software to move robot arms but my passion at the time was video games.

For 19 years I ended up making many [video games](/games/) on PC, PlayStation 2 and 3, and XBox 360. I worked for lots of famous games companies from the 90s and 2000s such as Ocean, Infogrames, Acclaim, Sony, and EA.

In 2013, I decided to leave the world of video games and find some work/life balance. I became a Principal Software Engineer at the BBC and helped to build their gaming APIs. I quickly learnt a lot about web technologies and cloud infrastructure.

My team was responsible for building [BBC Account](https://account.bbc.com/signin/) - the authentication and authorisation services for every audience member who uses the BBC's services. We enabled personalisation on a huge scale!

While building BBC Account I learnt a lot about microservice architecture, Node.js and the npm ecosystem, the React JavaScript library, [JavaScript testing](/javascript-testing/), AWS infrastructure, and building scalable, resilient services. There's nothing scarier than learning how to ensure your services can handle the spike of traffic that the [Strictly Come Dancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly_Come_Dancing) vote brings you!

Although I managed teams back at Sony in the mid-2000s, I properly transitioned from a Principal Engineer role into a Software Engineering Team Lead management role at the BBC. This really changed my thinking about how to build effective software engineering teams. It allowed me to ensure we had a culture of inclusion and psychological safety with no such thing as a silly question. It made me think more about diversity and how I can help to enable it.

I've continued my journey into technical leadership after leaving the BBC with a number of Engineering Manager roles. I'm now as Senior Engineering Manager at Netlify helping to build the future of the web.

## I almost died

Life also throws you curveballs sometimes. In June 2014, I contracted a streptococcal infection which caused sepsis. My body shut down and I suffered multiple organ failure. I [almost died](/how-i-almost-died/).

I spent 45 days in intensive care, learning how to breathe, and eat again.

I spent another 45 days on a hospital ward learning how to move my arms and walk again.

It was tough going.
 
Thankfully, I managed to survive but it's changed the way I look at life. My wife Clare also wrote about the experience for her and our children in more details. You should read her [Out Of The Woods Blog](https://outofthewoodsblog.com).

## I :heart: music

I've always loved music and in the early-80s hip-hop arrived in the UK. My brother and I loved to listen to the Streetsounds Electro compilations. Back in 1988 I realised I was never going to be a rapper so I convinced my parents to help me to buy a set of Technics 1210s and a Radio Shack Realistic DJ mixer. This helped me to learn how to mix 2 records together and how to cut and scratch.

Although I continue to love hip-hop, the late 80s acid house movement gained pace and I went with it. I moved to Manchester in 1990 and spent my weekends clubbing at places like The Ha√ßienda, The Boardwalk, The Academy, and The Wiggly Worm. I because a DJ regular on the Manchester house music circuit and through my good friend Mark Wyss, started DJing in Germany under my pseudonym [DJ Cruze](https://www.djcruze.co.uk/). I continued to DJ in Germany from 1993 until around 2012 and played at many of Germany's finest club nights. Good times!

Outside of work you'll find me helping my wife [Clare Littlemore](https://clarelittlemore.com/) to persue her writing career. I'm help with anything digital and she's the expert on the English language. I also love playing with my kids and helping them to grow up to be wonderful human beings.
