Over the past couple of years, some wonderful people have asked me to contribute to their podcasts and websites. I talk about technology, the games industry, my love of learning, and how I try and achieve a postive work-life balance. Have a read or take a listen below to hear my thoughts and stories.

### Dev To Manager - October 2020

[Siddhant Goel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhantgoel/) emailed me to see if I'd be interested in sharing my experience of transitioning from a software engineering role to a managerial position. His DevToManager website is a platform dedicated to interviewing engineering leaders on how to make the jump from software development to management. I was keen to share my views and to help other engineers who were interested in team leadership to consider management as their next step. You can read about my story on the [Dev To Manager](https://devtomanager.com/interviews/marc-littlemore/) website.
