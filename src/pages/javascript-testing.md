Over the past few years I've been introduced to test driven development (TDD) in combination with using JavaScript and Node.js. It's something that I really enjoyed learning and then talking about. TDD is the practice of writing new production code by first writing a failing test. It often leads to reduced defects or bugs in your code, and helps to define a code contract for your applications.

However, it's often very confusing and difficult for beginners to get started. Here I hope to help beginners to get started with testing their JavaScript and also encourage less experienced developers to gain unit and integration testing skills for their JavaScript code.
