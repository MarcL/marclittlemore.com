This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](https://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](https://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## What's happening right now?

### Updated: 22nd April 2023

#### Life

Life has been pretty tough over the past 10 months after family medical issue for my mum. It's taken it's toll both physically and mentally so hence the lack of an update on my now page. Thankfully, things are slowly getting better but it's still hard work.

The family are all doing well and we're helping my son through his GCSEs. He's working hard and we're really proud of what he's achieved so far. He'll go on to do fantastic things in the future I'm sure. My daughter is also working hard at school and is doing really well. She's a very talented young lady.

My [wife](https://www.clarelittlemore.com/) continues to amaze me as an author and is just finishing the 4th book in her Bellator Chronicles series. She's working hard on the editing and marketing and it should be out soon. I'm really proud of her and continue to give her the tech support she needs.

While I've not had the mental capacity to do much recently, I've been coding a little bit more and learning more TypeScript. I've also been getting back into making music and have fired up Ableton Live again. I've not made much music for the past few years but I'm really enjoying working on a new drum and bass track. It's something I've never tried before so I'm really enjoying the challenge and creative process.

I'm also trying to improve my health with more mountain biking and also taking some reformer pilates classes to get my back into a better shape. I'm really enjoying it so far.

I'm stil attempting to read more and you can check out the current [books I'm reading](/reading/) here.

#### Work

I've really been enjoying my Senior Engineering Manager role at [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). I've been there for almost a year now and have been leading up the Frameworks team. We've been trying to ensure that you can build any type of site on Netlify and have a smooth experience.

It's a tough economic climate in the tech industry right now so there are many challenges for us to overcome. However, I'm hoping that Netlify will continue to grow and we'll be able to continue doing great work to enable improvements in the composable web.
