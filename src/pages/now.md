This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## Currently doing

- Considering my career and what to do next
- Continuing to use and understand [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for better note taking
- Learning [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to rebuild my wife's [Out Of The Woods Blog](http://outofthewoodsblog.com/)

Check out the current [books I'm reading](/books) here.
