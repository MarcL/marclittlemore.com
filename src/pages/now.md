This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## Currently doing

- Last few days of my 30-day writing challenge
- Getting ready for my new job with [Gamma](https://www.gamma.co.uk/) as an Engineering Manager
- Learning how to use [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) for better video editing
- Continuing to learn [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to rebuild my wife's [Out Of The Woods Blog](http://outofthewoodsblog.com/)

Check out the current [books I'm reading](/books) here.
