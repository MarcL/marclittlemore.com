This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## Currently working on

- Coping with the current Coronavirus pandemic!
- Regular excercise with [Fitness Blender](https://www.fitnessblender.com/)
- Mountain biking on an almost daily basis
- Trying to work out what to do for a side project

## Currently reading

- [Essentialism: The Disciplined Persuit of Less](https://amzn.to/3ivZ57Z) by [Greg McKeown](https://gregmckeown.com/)
