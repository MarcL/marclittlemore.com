This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](https://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](https://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## Currently doing
- Learning about SIP and XMPP at [Gamma](https://www.gamma.co.uk/)
- Learning about email marketing
- Continuing to learn [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to rebuild my wife's [Out Of The Woods Blog](http://outofthewoodsblog.com/) and this website

Check out the current [books I'm reading](/books) here.
