This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](https://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](https://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## What's happening right now?

### Updated: 11th January 2025

Well I've not updated my now page in a while so better late than never!

#### Work

I'm now at [n8n](https://n8n.io) working as an Engineering Manager for their enterprise team. I've only been there for 6 months but I'm really enjoying the challenge. It's a complex platform but I have loved automation for a long time so it's great to be working on a product that I actually use.

#### Family

Life is pretty hectic now that the kids are older. My son is currently auditioning for drama schools so a lot of our effort is going into helping him with that. It's a tough business but he's got the resilience to make it I'm sure. He's also learning to drive so when we're not oing to auditions, we're practicing driving for his upcoming test. Fingers crossed he'll pass.

My daughter is halfway through the first year of her GCSEs so we're helping her get ready for those. She's incredibly hard workign so I know she'll do really well. She's also loving all of her musical theatre classes too and is performing in a few shows this year which we're excited to watch.

My wife [Clare](https://www.clarelittlemore.com) is busy writing as always but she's also taken on some more tutoring during the day, in addition to her tutoring after school. I'm always really proud of how hard she works and how fantastic she is at helping kids to prepare for their exams.

#### Health

I've now been working out 4 times per week at a gym since July 2023. It's a mix of cardio and weights and it's probably the fittest I've been in my whole life. I still suffer from the occasional back issues but ensuring that I'm working on my core has helped it to become less of a problem. It's also been fantastic for my mental health. Seeing a great bunch of guys in their 40s and 50s working out each morning is really inspiring. And I can't believe that I actually enjoy lifting weights now!

Thanks to all of my health issues with [nearly dying](/how-i-almost-died/) back in 2014, I've been having more issues with my feet again. I'm waiting on an appointment with a consultant because of constant pain in my heel. It will probably involve some surgery at some point in the next six months but at least it should make my foot hurt a little less.
