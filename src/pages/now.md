This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## Currently working on

- Regular excercise
- Mountain biking on an almost daily basis
- Updating my [DJ Cruze](http://www.djcruze.co.uk/) website using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)

Check out the current [books I'm reading](/books) here.
