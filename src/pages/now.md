This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page](https://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](https://nownownow.com/) movement. The purpose of this page is to share my current focus.

## Currently doing

- Trying to work out what to do as a side project
- Attempting to meditate more - I'm feeling somewhat stressed out at the moment

Check out the current [books I'm reading](/books) here.
