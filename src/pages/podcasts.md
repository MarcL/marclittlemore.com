### Make Life Work Podcast - March 2020

Earlier in 2020, I caught up with my long time internet friend, [Si Jobling](https://sijobling.com/), to chat on his [Make Life Work Podcast](https://sijobling.com/makelifework/). Si is an experienced developer and now a Tech Delivery Lead at WorldFirst. In this episode I share the story of my journey into the world of technology, my career making video games, my DJing and house music podcasts, how [sepsis nearly killed me](/how-i-almost-died/), and much, much more.
