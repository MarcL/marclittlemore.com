Application security is often an afterthought for developers, as we concentrate on the next shiny new feature for our projects. In this talk, we’ll highlight the importance of application security and explore some simple and practical ways that we as developers can defend our services from intrusion.

We’ll look at how my team at the BBC approached security concerns when creating the new BBC ID applications, and dive into some code examples to explore the best practices for Node.js server security.
