How do you learn to write great unit tests? Why are some unit tests good and some bad? I'm a big evangelist of test driven development (TDD) and of software testing in general. It's amazing how much confidence a suite of hundreds or thousands of tests give you when you're deploying your code. I've previously written about [writing great unit tests](/how-to-write-high-quality-unit-tests/) but I thought I'd turn that information into some slides and record a video. Although I am mainly coding using JavaScript and Node.js, here I talk about what you should think about to create useful unit tests in any programming language. Hopefully it'll give you a few tips to start writing your own unit tests for your projects.
