This is a talk I gave to the [Tech Returners](https://techreturners.com/) in Manchester in May 2018. I was asked to come in and share how I first got into technology and software development, and how my career progressed. I share how my love of Space Invaders and an Atari VCS got me into computer programming, and how I went from videogames to building the authentication system at the BBC. I also share some tips for getting into the software development industry and answer some common questions I get from new developers.

If you have any questions then get in [contact](/contact) or tweet at me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marclittlemore).
