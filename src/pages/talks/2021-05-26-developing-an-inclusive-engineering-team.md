The key to writing great software is a great engineering team, but building those great teams is more than finding the best developers. It’s about creating a positive and inclusive environment which helps the whole team to thrive.

In this talk, I share some ideas about how you can help to guide a team of fantastic software engineers to success. You’ll learn how to create an open and honest environment where all of your team help each other to flourish.
