I was invited to talk at the first virtual meetup for the wonderful [Devs Connect](https://www.meetup.com/devsconnect/). Created by a team of engineering managers and recruiters based in the North West of England, it gives people a great opportunity to share their knowledge with a series of lightning talks on various technology subjects. I care deeply about building positive and inclusive software engineering teams so I chose to talk about developing an inclusive software engineering team.

In this talk, I share some ideas about how you can help to guide a team of fantastic software engineers to success. You’ll learn how to create an open and honest environment where all of your team help each other to flourish.

Enjoy!
