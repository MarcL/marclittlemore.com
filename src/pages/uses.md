## Hardware

- I use a 15" Macbook Pro (Mid 2014) for work and it's been a great laptop for many years now. The battery does drain far too quickly now though.
- I switched to a Mac back in the early 2010's when I started doing some iPhone development so I have a Mac Mini (Mid 2010) too. The hard-drive died back in 2014 so, after an update and a new drive, it does work but I rarely turn it on any more. I do run the [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/) media server on it from time to time.
- I also have a Dell Vostro 430 desktop machine with Windows 10 on it. This gets turned on for games and the kids use it too.

## Editor & Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my code editor of choice. I switched over in September 2016 and absolutely love it.
- I've used the [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda) for VS Code for a while now.
- I use the mono-spaced [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font for development work but I don't enable the ligatures. I still like two symbols rather than a single character for code like `!=` and `=>`.
- I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as my terminal with the [Z Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) rather than bash. No real reason other than I started using it after moving over to using [dotfiles](https://github.com/MarcL/dotfiles) and I like the plugin and theme system.

## Applications

- I started using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) as it used to have better searching than Spotlight. I've never moved off it when Spotlight improved.
- I take a lot of notes, especially for work, and I use a combination of [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) and [Evernote](https://evernote.com/).
- I use [Slack](https://slack.com/) on most week days for work. I lead a very remote-friendly team at the BBC so it's a must for communication.
- Due to my excessive emoji use, I also use [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) to enable Slack colon emojis in other apps too.
- I often code late into the night, when I know I shouldn't, and I've used [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) for years now to protect my eyes from the brightness of a glaring monitor. Again, this has been replaced by OSX Night Shift but I've just stuck with Flux.
- I like to avoid using a mouse / trackpad if I can so I like to use a window manager to move them around using keyboard shortcuts. I used [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) for years in OSX but it's no longer supported. I've just switched to [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) which seems to be an open-source fork of the project.
- I switch between various messaging apps like [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), [Facebook Messenger](https://messenger.com/), or [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) depending on who I'm chatting to. Telegram is primarily used to allow me to build interesting automations with its [bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots). I like being able to type my messages quickly using OSX apps rather than the phone apps if I can.
- My browser of choice is Chrome, mainly because I use Google's tools (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and so on) on a daily basis.
- All of the above are installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask). Take a look at my [Brewfile](https://github.com/MarcL/dotfiles/blob/master/Brewfile) in my dotfiles for more info. This allows me to move to a new machine and be up and running incredibly quickly.
- I use Gmail on the web as my primary email but I also use [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) for another email account.
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) is something I use multiple times a day for video and audio communication. It's been the best video calling service I've used to date and works well for a remote working.

## Recording

- For recording my screen and videos for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/marclittlemore), I use [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html).
- I've produced electronic music for a long time and used to record a podcast back in the mid 2000's. I've always had an [AKG C1000S](https://www.akg.com/Microphones/Condenser%20Microphones/C1000_S.html) microphone for recording. I'm not a microphone expert but it does the job for me.
- To ensure I have great audio quality, and to enable low-latency audio for music production, I use a [Focusrite Sapphire 2i2](https://focusrite.com/en/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-2i2) audio interface. It's light and USB powered and does the job.
- I've DJ'ed since 1988 and I can't stand bad audio. Since my days in nightclubs spinning vinyl, I've sworn by Senheiser headphones. My current (and previous) pair are the [Senheiser HD25](https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/on-ear-dj-headphone-hd25). I've used them in clubs and for studio monitoring, as well as just listening to music. I live in a pair of headphones most of the time and they help me to concentrate, even if I forget to put my music on!
