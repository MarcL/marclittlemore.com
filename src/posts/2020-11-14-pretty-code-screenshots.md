If you're a developer, and you hang out on developer Twitter, then you'll have seen people sharing their hot code tip. They're often accompanied by code examples and the hot tip fire emoji ðŸ”¥.

Here's a great example from [Simon HÃ¸iberg](https://twitter.com/SimonHoiberg):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JavaScript Tip ðŸ’¡<br><br>Make an argument &#39;required&#39; in JavaScript using this small trick ðŸ‘‡ <a href="https://t.co/yZ2w5Kd58b">pic.twitter.com/yZ2w5Kd58b</a></p>&mdash; Simon HÃ¸iberg (@SimonHoiberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonHoiberg/status/1327314535540162565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

These are _not ordinary code screenshots_ straight from a code editor. They contain the code, syntax highlighting for the language, and are often embedded in a browser window with a colourful background.

**It's a beautiful code screenshot!**

If you read the comments on these code tweets, you'll usually see a list of people asking how to create such pretty code screenshots. So how do we do it?

There are many tools available to create these so let's take a look at how to create them then you can share them too.

## [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh)

![Carbon screenshot](/images/posts/carbon-screenshot.png)

[Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) is one of the easiest tools to use. You can quickly create great looking code screenshots on their website. Their code is also [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-app/carbon) if you want to use it yourself.

Type your code into their online editor and you can see a prettified version of it inside a Mac-styled window. It allows you to choose a variety of code themes and can syntax highlight your code in various programming languages. You can also alter the background colour, padding, and many other window or editor options. Play around with it to see what you can create.

{% callout "tip" %}
If you use [GitHub gists](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists) then you can create an image from one of those. Append the identifier of your gist to the Carbon URL and you'll see a pretty version of your code. For example here's [my gist](https://gist.github.com/MarcL/0561c83e8445f3ffc801a5a13415abef) and it we use the ID "`0561c83e8445f3ffc801a5a13415abef`" in the Carbon URL like this "`https://carbon.now.sh/0561c83e8445f3ffc801a5a13415abef`" then we see the screenshot above.

## Non-code screenshots

In some cases you might not need to take screenshots of code. Instead you can make pretty screenshots of websites, photos, or any other image you might have. There are a few ways to do this.

### [Screely](https://www.screely.com/)

![Screely screenshot](/images/posts/screely-screenshot.png)

[Screely](https://www.screely.com/) is a great website which works in a similar way to Carbon. It allows you to use any image file and displays it in a browser-style window. Again, you have the ability to style the image with a variety of options for the background colour, padding, and window type and style. Have fun and make your non-code images beautiful too.

### Windows

The simplest way to save a copy of whatever is on your computer screen is to simply press the "Print Screen" key on your keyboard. It's usually labeled "PrtScn" (or something very similar) and is located in the top row, among or near the Function keys. 

On some keyboards (particularly laptops) you might need to trigger the Print Screen using the Function key (in other words, hold the Function key and then press PrtScn).

Press Alt + PrtScn. This copies the active window to the clipboard, which you can paste into another program. 

### Mac

Shift-Command-4 
Use this keyboard combo to turn your cursor into a crosshair, which you can drag to select a portion of your screen to capture. Release the mouse button or trackpad to take the shot.

You have a number of other options after hitting Shift-Command-4:

Press and release the space bar: The crosshair turns into a little camera icon, which you can move over any open window. Click on your desired window to take a screenshot of it. A screenshot captured by this method features a white border around the window with a bit of a drop shadow.

Press and hold the space bar (after dragging to highlight an area but before releasing the mouse button or trackpad): This locks in the shape and size of the selection area but lets you reposition it on the screen. It's very handy if your initial selection area is off by a few pixels; just hold down the space bar to reposition it before releasing the mouse button to snap a screenshot.

Hold down the Shift key (after dragging to highlight an area but before releasing the mouse button or trackpad): This locks in each side of the selection area made with the crosshairs save the bottom edge, letting you move your mouse up or down to position the bottom edge. 

Without releasing the mouse button, release the Shift key and hit it again to reposition the right edge of your selection area. You can toggle between moving the bottom edge and right edge by keeping the mouse button or touchpad engaged and pressing the Shift key.
