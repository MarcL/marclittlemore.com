I went to the [Lead Developer Conference](https://theleaddeveloper.com/) back in 2019. [Pat Kau](https://www.patkua.com/) gave a fantastic talk called "Flavours of technical leadership". In the talk, he shared different ways that engineering leaders develop and make a difference to their teams. One of his thoughts really resonated with me:

Share your network

## What does it mean?

I wrote a little bit about sharing your network in my article on [lifting your team up](/lift-your-team-up/). Most strong leaders use networking to develop relationships in their team and beyond. Talking to people is a good way to forge personal and professional relationships and enable you and your team to do your best work.

The Harvard Business Review's "How leaders create and use networks", Herminia Ibarra and Mark Lee Hunter suggest that there are three different types of networks:

### 1. Operation network

An operation network consists of people that help to fulfil your current responsiblities and day-to-day tasks. They may be people in your immediate team and direct managers or stakeholders. 

### 2. Personal network

These are likeminded people outside your own organisation who can assist your personal development and boost your advancement. You might know them through a mutual interest or pastime – but you can still leverage your acquaintance for business success. Ibarra and Hunter say: “these contacts provide important referrals, information, and, often, developmental support such as coaching and mentoring”.

### 3. Strategic network

These are external people who will draw your attention to new business possibilities, new directions and new stakeholders necessary to achieve the key objectives of your organisation. According to Ibarra & Hunter, “The key to a good strategic network is leverage: the ability to marshal information, support, and resources from one sector of a network to achieve results in another.”

## Leaders should share their network

Create opportunities

You can lift the whole team up by sharing your network, especially if you've been at a company for a while. You'll have gained a reputation, and hopefully a good one. Use this to sponsor members of your team. Introduce them to other people they might not normally meet and create those opportunities for career growth. Lend your privilege to others who may not have it yet. A short introduction to another team might not mean much to you, but it'll do wonders for the confidence of your engineer who is being raised up to represent your team.
