When I was young, I used to love watching TV when I got in from school. I was a child of the 70s and 80s here in the UK so I only had about 1.5 to 2 hours of children's TV until the soap operas and news started. I'd eat my dinner and then jump on to my VIC-20 or C64. They had no internet connection. No games without spending 30 minutes waiting for a game to load from a cassette tape. Instead, I'd write my own programs. I was a creator.

My kids love YouTube. I love YouTube. It's easy to watch one video and then get sucked down a rabbit hole of related videos. Before you know it you've spend 4 hours watching videos on food gadgets for your kitchen, how to light Zoom videos, or how to take better notes. Or is that just me?

I guesstimate that 90%+ of the people who consume content stay in that phase.

And that's fine.

But by starting to produce content you'll start to find what you enjoy. You'll discover what you're good at and want you're not. It can start to set a direction for your hobbies or maybe your work life. Repeat this regularly and you'll become a creator.

Set the bar low to begin with. I'm almost at the end of a [30-day writing habit](/creating-a-writing-habit/). I've struggled with the attempting to write too much but it could just be a quick blog post. Or a 5-minute podcast. Or a quick drawing.

Document what you've made and share it with others. Post a link, picture or video on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok or YouTube. It's a small amount of extra effort but sharing with others will get them excited about what you do. Having a network, and then [sharing your network with others](/share-your-network/), will help you to grow.

Schedule time to do it. I've found that setting a specific time each evening has really helped me to write more. I've not always achieved it every night but I've definitely written much more than I have in the past 5 years. Taking control of your schedule will make you be a producer of content and not just a passive consumer.

Turn off notifications and block your apps. I've found this the hardest. While writing this I had WhatsApp enabled. A friend messaged me about a Twitch DJ stream I wanted to hear. It delayed me from starting this post for an hour. I should have turned off all none essential applications and blocked any websites except this text editor I'm using to write this post.

Build a streak and form a good habit. [Jerry Seinfeld wrote every day](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy) and created a habit of writing. He wasn't looking for results. He was looking for consistency which would eventually bring results. That's what you need to do to become a creator. Just get started.

And finally, look to repurpose your content in multiple ways. A video can be cut up for Instagram or TikTok. A blog post can be linked to on Twitter or cut up into multiple tweets. Use quotes from your blog post to answer questions on Quora. There are so many ways to share your content and increase your reach.

So do you want to just sit there and consume content? Or do you want to make something?

Get creating!
