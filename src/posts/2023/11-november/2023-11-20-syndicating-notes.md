As someone who has been using Twitter since 2008, it's been a big part of my life since the early days of the [fail whale](https://business.time.com/2013/11/06/how-twitter-slayed-the-fail-whale/). Honestly, I was probably addicted to it at times and took the Twitter app on and off my phone to try and break the scrolling habit.

I've met lots of fantastic people through it, I've learned a lot from it, and I've probably shared far too much on it. But since a billionaire finally bought it and took it over in October 2022, it's not the same place it was when I joined. It's become a place of anger, hate, and misinformation. Most of the great people I have followed have stopped tweeting.

As we all did, I looked for an alternative platform and I signed up to all of them, as most techies did. So, you can find me on [Mastodon]({{socialMedia.mastodon.url}}), [Bluesky]({{socialMedia.bluesky.url}}), [Threads]({{socialMedia.threads.url}}), and yes, I'm on [LinkedIn]({{socialMedia.linkedin.url}}) too if that's your thing.

The trouble with all of these platforms is that I get FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) that I'm posting my content to the wrong platform. What's the right place to share my ramblings with the world? :smile:

## Enter the IndieWeb

{% callout "info" %}
**What is the IndieWeb?**

The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb) is a community of independent & personal websites connected by simple standards, based on the principles of: owning your domain & using it as your primary identity, publishing on your own site (optionally syndicating elsewhere), and owning your data.
{% endcallout %}

I've been following the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) movement for a while and it got me thinking about how I can use their ideas to keep my content on my site but syndicate it to the various social media platforms. This idea is known as [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. This means you own your content and publish your thoughts on your own site first, then syndicate it to other platforms in a format that suits.

I was inspired by some great articles by [Max BÃ¶ck](https://mxb.dev/blog/syndicating-content-to-twitter-with-netlify-functions/) and [Matthias Ott](https://matthiasott.com/notes/syndicating-posts-personal-website-twitter-mastodon) who have both written about how they syndicate their content to other platforms. As a developer, it sounded like a fun challenge to see how I could use 11ty to post small notes to my site and automate the process of sending them to other platforms.

So let's do it...

## Create an Eleventy note collection

Creating a new [eleventy collection](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/) to group my notes together is the easy part if you've got an 11ty site!

Using its tagging system, you can create a new collection. I like to put each collection into a new folder in my project as 11ty allows you to have per-directory configuration. This means we can set all of our note settings in one place.

 I created a new folder called `notes` and added a new file called `notes.json` to it. I set up a `layout` to be able to render each note on its own URL and added a `tags` array to allow me to create a `notes` collection. I also added a `syndicate` flag to allow me to filter notes that I want to syndicate to other platforms or not on a per-note basis. This will be an enhancement that I've not implemented yet.

 Here's what the configuration looks like:

{% codetitle "notes/notes.json" "Eleventy config" %}

```json
{
  "layout": "note",
  "tags": ["note"],
  "syndicate": "true",
}
```

Each note is a markdown file with some front matter set up. It's up to you want you want to post to social media but at a basic level it's some text content with a `date`. You don't really need a title for it but you could add one if you wanted to display it on the note page. The date is used on my site and won't 100% reflect the point when the note was posted to social media as it'll depend on when we actually post it. Also, the `date` can be set via the filename if you want to and it doesn't have to be set in the front matter. I'm not too worried about that at the moment but it's probably something I can look to improve by writing back to the file at the point of posting with the API.

Here's an example note markdown file:

{% codetitle "notes/2023-11-20-syndicating-notes.md" "Note markdown file" %}

{% raw %}
```markdown
---
syndicate: true
date: 2023-11-19T23:10:00.000Z
---

ðŸ‘‹ Testing out posting notes from my blog via APIs.
```
{% endraw %}


I also created a `/notes` page to render all of the notes on my site. This is a simple [11ty liquid template](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/liquid/) that loops through all of the notes in a collection and renders them using the `note` partial. It doesn't yet have pagination but I'll added that as an improvement once I start posting more notes.

{% codetitle "notes.md" "Notes page" %}

{% raw %}
```liquid
---
title: Notes
description: Notes for my microblog which are syndicated to social media platforms.
permalink: /notes/
---

<div>
    {% for note in collections.note reversed %}
        {% include partials/noteCard.html, noteContent: note.content, noteImage: note.data.image, noteDate: note.date, noteUrl: note.url %}
    {% endfor %}
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

My `note` layout is very simple. It renders the content of the note and adds a link to the original note on my site. I add in a link to the note page if it's not being rendered in our specific note layout.

{% codetitle "partials/noteCard.html" "Note template" %}

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% assign isDetailView = layout == 'note' %}

<div class="prose-slate shadow-xl rounded-md p-4 noteCard">
    {% if noteImage %}
      <div>
        {% image noteImage.url noteImage.alt "my-4 sm:my-0 shadow-lg rounded-md" false %}
      </div>
    {% endif %}
    <div class="content">
      {{noteContent}}
    </div>
    <div class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-base py-1 my-0.5">
      {{noteDate | date: "%H:%M %p - %b %d, %Y"}}
      {% if isDetailView == false %}| <a href="{{noteUrl}}">Note link</a>{% endif %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

If you take a look at my [notes page](/notes/) you'll see it in action.

So now we've got a collection of notes. I can add a new markdown file and it will be added to the collection and displayed on my notes page. So far, so good!

Now we need to look at how we can post these notes to our social media platforms.

## Create Node.js scripts to share notes

As I've used JavaScript for a long time now, I wanted to make an easy way to post all new notes using Node.js. I created a script which needs to do the following:

- Find all of the `notes` markdown files in the collection
- Read the file and extract both the YAML front matter and the content
- *[Optional]* Convert any markdown in the content back to plain text
- Determine if the post has already been posted
- Post the note to the social media platform if needed
- Record the fact that the note has been posted

### Find all of the notes

I use a [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) library to find all of the markdown files in the `notes` folder. I use `fast-glob` but you can use any library you like. It would be good to leverage 11ty to do this but there's no easy way to hook into it as a post-build step.

{% codetitle "scripts/postNotes.js" "Find all of the notes" %}

```javascript

{% codetitle "scripts/postNotes.js" "Note template" %}

```javascript

{% codetitle "scripts/postNotes.js" "Note template" %}

```javascript
const glob = require('fast-glob');

const postLatestNotes = async () => {
  // Because 'parse-md' is an ESM module, we have to dynamically import it
  const { default: parseMd } = await import('parse-md');

  const notePaths = await glob(['src/notes/**/*.md'], {
    cwd: process.cwd(),
  });

  // More code to come...
};

// I'm still using CommonJS (not ESM) so I need to wrap the async function in an IIFE
(async () => {
  await postLatestNotes();
})();
```

### Read and parse each note

We need to iterate through each file and read the contents. As we're reading markdown, we'll can separate the front matter for our configuration from the content. We'll use a library called [parse-md](https://github.com/rpearce/parse-md) to do this. Note in the code above that I'm using a dynamic `import` to load the library. This is because my script is using CommonJS and the library is using ESM.

I also remove the markdown from the content using my own code. It adds a markdown renderer which changes each token to plain text. I've not included the code here as this is something you don't need to do if you're not using markdown syntax in your notes.

{% codetitle "scripts/postNotes.js" "Read and parse each note" %}

```javascript
  // Iterate over each note markdown file that we found
  notePaths.map(async (path) => {
    // Read the markdown file
    const fileContent = await fs.readFile(path, 'utf-8');

    // Parse the markdown file into front matter metadata and content
    const { metadata, content } = parseMd(fileContent);
    
    // Optional: Remove markdown from the content
    const text = markdownToTxt(content);
    
    // ...
  });
```

## Check we've not posted them already

- Generate a JSON file with links to the existing notes
- Check the JSON file to see if we've posted it already

## What's next?

### Automation and Tools

- Use GitHub workflow to post notes automatically on merge

### Add Threads API

- Waiting for the API to be released

### Automation
- Using GitHub actions or Netlify functions

### Image Uploads
- Upload images

### Threaded Notes

- Split up text appropriately - simple check per-platform and it fails at the moment
- Create threads
- Link back to original note

### Optimise the code

The code doesn't need to be overly efficient when I've only got a few notes but it could become much slower.
