Although I've managed to write quite a few blog posts over the past 10 years, over the past 2 years I've only managed to add 2 more to this site.

As everyone who has a family knows, real life can easily take over.

Over the past few years I've been helping two teenage children to grow and thrive into young adults. I've also had to become a partial carer for my mum who suffered from a stroke back in 2022. And I've managed to be laid off from yet another tech job, this time at Netlify back in May 2024, and had to find another role. So it's pretty understandable that blogging wasn't top of mind.

Social media has rapidly changed over the past few years. Twitter has become a bit of a cesspool after Elmo took over, Facebook now mostly serves posts from groups you're not part of and is also now allowing even more misinformation and hate speech due to [the change in their policies](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/08/metas-changes-to-social-media-policing-will-lead-to-clash-with-eu-and-uk-say-experts). Although Bluesky is making strides in becoming a nice place to share your thoughts with the world, I do feel like I need to keep my own place on the internet and start posting a bit more on here.

I always felt like I had to have big ideas to write about and that my posts should be really insightful. But I've read lots of great blog posts that are just a few paragraphs long and are just someone sharing their thoughts and ideas. I was often paralysed by the thought that people would judge what I've written but I've come to realise that I should just write for myself and if people read it then that's a bonus!

I've also been inspired by a few blog posts that I've read recently.

My old Netlify colleague Den Delimarsky wrote a great post about [being a property owner and not a renter on the internet](https://den.dev/blog/be-a-property-owner-not-a-renter-on-the-internet/). He's writing a great post eschewing social media platforms and ensuring that we all help to build our own little homes on the internet where platform owners can't pull the rug from under us.

The ever-brilliant Simon Willison has written lots about blogging on his site. I don't know how he manages to publish multiple blog posts per day but he has some great advice on his post called [what to blog about](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/). He suggests writing more "today I learned" (TIL) posts about the challenges you encounter and how you fixed them. He also says you should write more about any projects you're working on so it's time to actually work on some more projects in the first place!

There's also the classic post by Jeff Atwood on [how to achieve ultimate blog success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/) from way back in 2007 which is still really relevant today.

Finally, I'm always inspired by my friend Sam Rose who has got some brilliant long-form articles on computer science topics on his wonderful [blog](https://samwho.dev/). You should really check this out if you haven't already as he writes incredible articles on complex computer science topics and includes his own wonderful visualisations. His posts are really engaging and he writes so anyone can understand them.

So 2025 will be a year where I post more regularly and don't worry about what others think. Everything will continue to be syndicated via my [RSS feed](/feed.xml) so if you're still an old-school RSS reader like me, you can get all of my posts there.

I'm also planning on making more music under my [DJ Cruze](https://djcruze.co.uk) moniker. I might even publish some videos or live-streams of me making the music too.

Continue to be excellent to each other and see you online soon!
