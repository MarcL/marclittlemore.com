I've been building some Facebook automations using [n8n](https://n8n.io/) and there's a bunch of hoops to jump through to get page access tokens for automation. I thought I'd take some notes so I remember how to do it in the future.

## Create a Facebook App

## Get App ID and App Secret

## Get a Long-Lived User Access Token

## Get a Long-Lived Page Access Token

## Automate with n8n
