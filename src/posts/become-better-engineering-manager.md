I didn't set out to become a manager of software engineers. One day I was the principal software engineer on the team. The next I'd shifted to a management track. I initially wasn't sure if I'd made the right move but I now really love building great software teasm.

I've dipped in and out of management over the years and I'm now a software engineering team lead and manage a team of 8 software engineers of different levels of experience. Here's are some things I've learnt which have helped me on my journey.

## It's a different career

A software engineering management role is often seen as the next step up from being a software engineer. It's not. It's a different discipline. If you love coding, you probably won't be doing much of it. There are many reasons to become a manager but make sure you know what you're getting into. Take a look at some [reasons to not be a manager](https://charity.wtf/2019/09/08/reasons-not-to-be-a-manager/) written by the awesome [Charity Majors](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy) before you take the role.

## You'll have imposter syndrome

You've spent 20+ years writing code. You can reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard while deploying a Kubernetes cluster. If you can do that, being a manager must be easy right?

STOP!

Your day of coding will be replaced 1:1s with your team, stakeholder meetings, backlog grooming in Jira, looking through résumés, writing technical documents, and so on. For a while you won't know what you're doing but perserve. The imposter syndrome may always be there but it will stop nagging you eventually. Ensure you find a network of peers that can help you to learn. Find other engineering leaders who have done this for a bit longer than you have. Share your journeys and you'll find that other people struggle at times too. A network of peers is really helpful. Meet regularly and it will help you all to grow.

## Build a culture of positivity and honesty

Your job is now to manage and lead a team. It's your job to set the tone for the team and help to define the team's culture. Be the one who builds a culture where all voices matter. A junior engineer can have great ideas like your more experienced developers but you must allow them to feel comfortable enough to share them. Help to set the expectations for code reviews and ensure that it feels like a learning experience rather than a telling off. Appreciate your team in public. If someone has written some great code or released a great new feature, share and celebrate it both inside and outside of the team. Most people are quick to complain about mistakes but aren't so fast at thanking people for great work.

## Trust is the key

Most people won't let you down. Trust them to do their best work without micromanaging them and telling them what to do. Yes, it's your resonsibility to ensure the work gets done but do this by setting the direction and not piloting the ship. If you do this then your team will trust you. There may be times when the team doesn't enjoy the work so your role is to explain the difficult choices which may have been made. If you've built an culture of honesty and openness, the team will understand. Allowing autonomy in the team will lead to greater motivation and a belief in their own decisions.

## Become a great listener and communicator

Your new role as a manager is mostly about clear communication. You'll be talking with project stakeholders about the requirements and deadlines for the project. You'll be sharing details with your team and setting the technical strategy for what you do. You'll be hearing about the needs and struggles of your team in their 1:1s. You'll have to provide mentoring and feedback for your team. What you say and how you say it will matter to the team, your manager, and other people you deal with. Try and learn how to write and speak clearly. This isn't easy but it's a skill you should attempt to get better at.

## Know that some conversations will be difficult

Your job as a manager means you'll have to deal with the good and the bad. Your team won't be happy all of the time. You'll need to be a great listener and able to deal with tricky conversations. This has been even more apparent over 2020 and a global pandemic! If you've built a culture of openness, these conversations should happen regularly and you should embrace the fact that your team feel comfortable enough to be honest with you about how they feel. If you don't know the answer, it's ok to say you don't know. Ensure you've got support networks to help you find answers. If it's a conflict within the team, talk to everyone involved and help to resolve it as quickly as you can.

## Your job isn't to know everything

When you first start to lead a team, you expect to be able to answer all of the questions from all of the people. You quickly realise that this isn't achievable. It's time to be comfortable with saying "I don't know" to people. It's better to become an enabler for the team. You might not know the answer but you can find out from your senior engineers, or other team members. Open up your network to the team and connect them with the people who can answer their questions. You become more valuable to the team when you realise you don't have to know everything but you can know where to find things.
