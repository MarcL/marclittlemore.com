I worked in the video games industry for almost 20 years. I [made quite a few games](/games) and worked on many more unreleased demos. Every company I worked at was incredibly secretive about their work. Very few teams shared what they were working on externally. Some didn't even share much between their internal teams either. We weren't really using open source software libraries either. The encouragement was to create our own code and share with nobody.

I moved to the BBC in 2013 and it changed the way I thought about my work. We started using GitHub to share code. We created pull requests and reviewed and critiqued each other's code. Yes, we almost never had code reviews in my games development days! I started seeing the value in sharing things with others before it was 100% complete.

The whole team was learning Node.js at the time and most of us hadn't touched it before. Sharing my code with the team encouraged them to comment on it and we all started learning the best way to architecture our applications.

That's why we should all think about learning in public.

## What is learning in public then?

Most of us learn something new by consuming content. We read a book or an online article. We watch a YouTube video or a Netflix documentary. And the thinking ends there. We might use that knowledge in private but we don't often share it with others.

Learning in public is creating a habit of re-teaching what you've learnt so that others can benefit. It allows you to clarify your understanding of the subject using [the protégé effect](https://effectiviology.com/protege-effect-learn-by-teaching/). You can teach it in lots of different ways:

- a blog post or tutorial on your website
- a YouTube video or live stream
- create some public example code on GitHub
- speaking at a local meetup
- starting a newsletter

Try your best to be right, but also **try not to worry if you get things wrong**. As [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) tells us, somebody will tell you when you're wrong on the internet:

When you haven't got all of the details correct, people may well tell you that your work is terrible. Accepting public criticism is tricky at first. Try not to care too much - I know that's hard initially. Ask them what's wrong and update your blog post or create a new video. As [Shaw SWYX Wang](https://twitter.com/swyx) says: *"make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning"*

## Why should I learn in public?

I don't know about you but I can't remember what I did last week.

Learning in public is a great way to help future you remember what you learnt last year. It helps the person who was in your shoes six months ago who has picked up the technology for the first time and wants to get started. Once you started writing more about a subject, you'll start to become an expert on it. People will come to you for advice and ask you questions online. I did this with my [chatbots](/bots) knowledge. I'd never written one before 2018 and within four months I had become an "expert" in the field but sharing my videos on YouTube.

In reality, a lot of online experts are online a few steps ahead of you. The reason you think they know so much is because they're sharing it with you. Most people don't. Sharing your learnings online and you can become one too. Eventually people will ask you for advice and may well offer to pay you for your time. Learning in public can lead to a side hustle and will definitely open the door to more opportunities. Who is a new employer going to look more favourably at? The person with just a resumé or the person with resumé which links to an expert blog post that people reference on the subject?

Learning in public also gives you the opportunity to amplify your message. Sure I can sit down with one person and teach them something I've learnt. But if I write it down, or make a YouTube video, I may reach 5, 50, or 500 people more easily. It allows you to scale your teaching and also your own learning.

## What to do next?

Learn something and write it down. Share those notes on your Twitter account. If you've got a blog then write a blog post. If you don't have a blog, learn how to set one up. And then write about the experience.

By writing out this article, it's made me attempt to clarify my thoughts on learning in public. Do the same with your learning and I look forward to reading or watching it.
